# Story 3.1: Read Archived HTML and Identify Posts

## Status: In-Progress

## Story

- As the Structured Data Extraction System,
- I want to iterate through the raw HTML files stored in the local "Waypoint Archive" (organized as per Epic 2), load the content of each page, and reliably identify the distinct HTML block corresponding to each individual post within that page,
- So that I can then process each post separately to extract its metadata and content.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

AC1: The system MUST be configurable with the root file path of the local "Waypoint Archive" created by Epic 2.
AC2: The system MUST be able to navigate the directory structure within the archive root (e.g., {ARCHIVE_ROOT}/{sub_forum_id_or_name}/{topic_id}/page_{page_number}.html).
AC3: The system MUST successfully read the raw HTML content from each .html file found within the archive structure.
AC4: For each loaded HTML page, the system MUST employ robust parsing techniques to identify and isolate the specific HTML section or element that contains the data for a single forum post.
AC5: The system MUST be able to handle pages with multiple posts and correctly identify each individual post block on the page.
AC6: The system MUST provide access to the isolated HTML content for each identified post block for subsequent processing steps (like metadata and content extraction).
AC7: The system MUST log the file path of each HTML page being processed and the number of post blocks successfully identified within that page.
AC8: The system MUST implement error handling for scenarios like unreadable files, missing files, or parsing errors, logging these issues and ideally continuing processing with other files where possible (as per docs/operational-guidelines.md).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: **Configuration and Archive Navigation (AC: 1, 2)**
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Implement logic to accept and store the root file path of the "Waypoint Archive".
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Develop file system traversal logic to navigate the archive's directory structure ({sub_forum_id_or_name}/{topic_id}/page_{page_number}.html).
- [ ] Task 2: **HTML File Reading and Post Block Identification (AC: 3, 4, 5, 6)**
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Implement HTML file reading functionality.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Research and select robust HTML parsing libraries/techniques (e.g., goquery for Go, BeautifulSoup for Python).
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Develop parsing logic to identify and isolate individual post blocks from a page's HTML content.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.4: Ensure the system can handle pages with varying numbers of posts.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.5: Ensure the isolated HTML for each post is accessible for further processing.
- [ ] Task 3: **Logging and Error Handling (AC: 7, 8)**
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Implement logging for processed HTML files and the count of identified post blocks.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Implement error handling for file access and parsing issues, with appropriate logging and continuation logic (referencing `docs/operational-guidelines.md`).

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Primary Language:** Go (or Python as fallback, confirm based on `docs/tech-stack.md`).
- **HTML Parsing:** Utilize libraries like `goquery` (if Go) or `BeautifulSoup4` (if Python) for robust HTML parsing. The specific HTML structure of "The Magic Cafe" posts will need to be analyzed to determine reliable selectors for post blocks.
- **Configuration:** The root archive path should be easily configurable (e.g., via a config file or command-line argument).
- **Dependencies:** This story depends on the output structure of Epic 2 (Raw HTML Archival System). The directory structure and file naming conventions from Epic 2 must be understood.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is crucial. The system should not crash on encountering a malformed HTML file or an unreadable file. Refer to `docs/operational-guidelines.md` for general error handling principles.
