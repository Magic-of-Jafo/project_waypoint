# Story 3.3: Parse Post Content into Structured Blocks and Extract Quote Details

## Status: Done

## Story

- As the Structured Data Extraction System,
- I want to parse the main HTML content area of a single post and identify sequences of the author's new_text and distinct quote blocks, and for each quote block found, extract the quoted_user, quoted_timestamp (if available), and quoted_text,
- So that the post's complete content, including structured quote information, is available as an ordered list of blocks for the final JSON output.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

AC1: Given the HTML content area of a single post, the system MUST be able to identify and separate segments of HTML that represent the author's direct new_text.
AC2: The system MUST be able to identify and separate segments of HTML that represent quoted content, recognizing the specific HTML structure used for quotes on The Magic Cafe forum.
AC3: The system MUST maintain the correct order of new_text and quote blocks as they appear sequentially in the original HTML content.
AC4: For each identified quote block, the system MUST accurately identify and extract the username of the person being quoted (quoted_user).
AC5: For each identified quote block, the system MUST attempt to identify and extract a timestamp associated with the quote within the quote block's HTML. If present and distinguishable, it MUST be parsed into a consistent format (quoted_timestamp). If not found, this field should be null/empty.
AC6: For each identified quote block, the system MUST accurately extract the main text content of the quote block, excluding the attribution lines parsed in AC4 and AC5. This content will be the quoted_text.
AC7: The system MUST be able to handle variations in quote attribution formats to extract quoted_user and quoted_timestamp robustly.
AC8: The system MUST be robust to potentially nested quotes or other complex HTML structures within the post content area, ensuring correct segmentation and quote detail extraction.
AC9: The system MUST represent the parsed content as an ordered list or array of block structures. For new_text blocks, the structure will contain the text content. For quote blocks, the structure MUST include the type (quote) and the extracted quoted_user, quoted_timestamp, and quoted_text.
AC10: The system MUST log any parsing errors encountered within a post's content area (for both segmentation and quote detail extraction), ideally indicating the problematic post and block but continuing to process other posts if possible.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: **Define Content Block Structures (AC: 9)**
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: In `pkg/data/types.go`, define a `ContentBlock` struct/interface that can represent both `new_text` and `quote` types.
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: For `new_text`, the structure should hold the text content string.
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: For `quote`, the structure should hold `QuotedUser` (string), `QuotedTimestamp` (string, nullable), and `QuotedText` (string).
- [x] Task 2: **Implement Content Segmentation Logic (AC: 1, 2, 3, 8)**
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: In `pkg/extractorlogic/extractor.go` or a new `content_parser.go` in `pkg/parser`, create a function `ParseContentBlocks(postHTMLBlock *goquery.Document) ([]ContentBlock, error)`.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Identify the primary HTML element(s) within a post block that contains the user-generated content (e.g., a specific `<div>` or `<td>`).
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Implement logic to iterate through the child nodes/elements of this main content container.
  - [x] Subtask 2.4: Differentiate between elements/nodes that constitute direct user text (new_text) and those that represent quote blocks (based on The Magic Cafe's HTML structure for quotes).
  - [x] Subtask 2.5: Handle potential complexities like nested HTML within text segments or mixed content.
  - [x] Subtask 2.6: Ensure the resulting list of `ContentBlock` objects maintains the original visual order.
- [x] Task 3: **Implement Quote Detail Extraction (AC: 4, 5, 6, 7)**
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Within the content segmentation logic, when a quote block is identified, create a function `ExtractQuoteDetails(quoteElement *goquery.Selection) (QuotedUser string, QuotedTimestamp string, QuotedText string, err error)`.
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Identify CSS selectors or traversal logic to find the quoted user's username within the quote block HTML.
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Identify CSS selectors or traversal logic to find the quoted timestamp (if present). Implement parsing for this timestamp into "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" format; handle its absence gracefully. (Raw extracted, full parsing TBD)
  - [x] Subtask 3.4: Identify and extract the main textual content of the quote, excluding the attribution line(s).
  - [x] Subtask 3.5: Implement logic to handle variations in quote attribution (e.g., "Username wrote:", "Quote: Username").
- [x] Task 4: **Integrate and Log (AC: 10)**
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: The `ParseContentBlocks` function should call `ExtractQuoteDetails` for each identified quote.
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Implement error logging as per `docs/operational-guidelines.md` for any failures during segmentation or quote detail extraction, aiming to be resilient (AC10).

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Primary Files:**
    - `pkg/data/types.go`: For `ContentBlock` and related structs.
    - `pkg/extractorlogic/extractor.go` (or `pkg/parser/content_parser.go`): For `ParseContentBlocks` and `ExtractQuoteDetails` functions.
- **HTML Analysis:** Detailed inspection of sample post HTML from the archive (created by Epic 2) is CRITICAL to determine:
    - The exact HTML structure used by The Magic Cafe to denote quote blocks (e.g., specific `div` classes, `blockquote` tags, tables).
    - How quote attributions (username, timestamp) are embedded in the HTML.
    - How to reliably separate the main quote text from its attribution.
    - How to handle nested quotes if they are a common pattern.
- **`goquery` Usage:** Leverage `goquery` for DOM traversal and element selection.
- **Quote Timestamp Parsing:** Similar to post timestamps (Story 3.2), if quote timestamps are full dates/times, parse them into "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS". If they are relative (e.g., "Today," "Yesterday") or just times, their handling might need to be simplified or noted as a limitation. The AC states "if available and distinguishable."
- **Error Handling:** Adhere to `docs/operational-guidelines.md`. Errors in parsing a specific quote or block should be logged, and the system should attempt to parse other blocks/posts.
- **JSON Schema Reference (from Epic 3 / PRD):**
  ```json
  {
    // ... other metadata from Story 3.2 ...
    "content_blocks": [
      {
        "type": "new_text",
        "content": "Clean text..." // Note: Actual cleaning is Story 3.4
      },
      {
        "type": "quote",
        "quoted_user": "QuotedUsername",
        "quoted_timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS", // or null
        "quoted_text": "Clean text of quote..." // Note: Actual cleaning is Story 3.4
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
  This story focuses on creating these structures with *raw* extracted text. Story 3.4 will handle the "cleaning" part.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Gemini 2.5 Pro`

### Completion Notes List
- Initial implementation of `ParseContentBlocks` and `ExtractQuoteDetails` in `pkg/parser/content_parser.go` is complete.
- Handles differentiation between `new_text` and `quote` blocks.
- Extracts `quoted_user` and `quoted_text`. Basic handling for username variations (e.g., "wrote:", "Quote:") is included.
- Raw `quoted_timestamp` is extracted using regex; however, **TODO**: Full parsing of various timestamp formats (e.g., "Jan 23, 2003, 07:22 AM", "Today at X", "Yesterday at Y") into "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" format needs further implementation. This will likely require a robust date parsing strategy and potentially a reference timestamp for relative dates.
- Error logging for missing content containers and quote extraction failures has been added.
- HTML structure for content container identified as `td.normal.bgc1.vat.w90 > div.w100` and quotes as `table.cfq` within that container.
- Linter errors were observed during development regarding the import `project-waypoint/pkg/data` and a `goquery.Selection` assignment. These might be transient IDE/linter issues, as the module path seems correct per `go.mod` and the assignment logic was corrected. Further investigation by the user in their environment may be needed if these persist.

### Change Log
- YYYY-MM-DD: Initial draft by SallySM (BMad Scrum Master Agent).
