# Story 3.4: Extract Clean Text from New Text Blocks

## Status: Done

## Story

- As the Structured Data Extraction System,
- I want to take the raw HTML content identified as a new_text block and convert it into clean, plain text, removing most HTML tags and unwanted formatting, but specifically preserving a representation of embedded emojis and essential readability elements like line breaks,
- So that the author's original contribution, including key non-textual elements like emojis, is accurately represented as a simple string within the structured JSON output.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

AC1: Given the raw HTML content of a new_text block, the system MUST remove standard HTML tags.
AC2: When encountering an <img> tag (commonly used for emojis), the system MUST attempt to extract the text from the alt or title attribute. If successful, this extracted text (e.g., ":)" or "Smile") SHOULD be inserted into the plain text output at the location of the image tag. If no alt or title is found, a placeholder (e.g., [image]) may be inserted, or the tag removed, depending on complexity/feasibility.
AC3: The system MUST preserve essential formatting like line breaks (e.g., converting <br> tags or similar HTML line break representations into newline characters \n in the plain text output).
AC4: The system MUST remove common BBCode opening and closing tags (e.g., [b], [/b], [i], [/i], [url=...], [/url]) while preserving the text content enclosed within those tags. (Exception: For link BBCode like [url=...]Text[/url], only the "Text" part is preserved; the URL itself may be lost unless explicitly decided otherwise).
AC5: The system SHOULD handle various forms of whitespace, collapsing redundant whitespace where appropriate without losing significant separation between words or paragraphs.
AC6: The resulting clean text MUST accurately reflect the author's message content and tone (as best as possible without full formatting).
AC7: The system MUST implement robust error handling for malformed HTML or BBCode within a new_text block, logging the issue but attempting to extract as much text as possible.
AC8: The extracted clean text content for each new_text block MUST be available to be included in the final post JSON structure.
AC9: The system MUST log when it encounters an <img> tag or BBCode during cleaning, especially if the handling is uncertain or results in potential data loss (e.g., no alt/title text on an image).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: **Implement HTML Tag Removal (AC: 1)**
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: In `pkg/parser/content_parser.go` (or a new `text_cleaner.go`), create a function `CleanNewTextBlock(rawHTML string) (string, error)`.
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Utilize an HTML parsing library (e.g., `golang.org/x/net/html` or a helper function that iterates nodes) to traverse the input `rawHTML`.
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Implement logic to extract text content from nodes while discarding most standard HTML tags (e.g., `<div>`, `<span>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, etc.).
- [x] Task 2: **Implement Emoji Image Handling (AC: 2, 9)**
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Within `CleanNewTextBlock`, specifically handle `<img>` tags.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Attempt to extract the `alt` attribute. If present and non-empty, use its value.
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: If `alt` is missing or empty, attempt to extract the `title` attribute. If present and non-empty, use its value.
  - [x] Subtask 2.4: If neither `alt` nor `title` provides useful text, insert a placeholder like "[image]" or "[emoji]". Make this configurable if necessary.
  - [x] Subtask 2.5: Log (as per AC9) when an `<img>` tag is encountered, detailing how it was handled (e.g., "Emoji image 'smile.gif' replaced with alt text ':)'", "Image 'icon.png' has no alt/title, replaced with [image]").
- [x] Task 3: **Implement Line Break Preservation (AC: 3)**
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Ensure that HTML line break tags (e.g., `<br>`, `<br />`) are converted to newline characters (`\n`) in the output string.
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Consider how block-level elements (e.g., `<p>`, `<div>` if not entirely stripped) might imply line breaks and handle accordingly to maintain readability.
- [x] Task 4: **Implement BBCode Removal (AC: 4, 9)**
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Implement regular expressions or a simple parser to identify and remove common BBCode tags (e.g., `[b]`, `[/b]`, `[i]`, `[/i]`, `[u]`, `[/u]`, `[color=...]`, `[/color]`, `[size=...]`, `[/size]`).
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: For `[url=...]Text[/url]` tags, extract and keep "Text", discarding the URL and the tags themselves. For simple `[url]...[/url]` tags, preserve the content.
  - [x] Subtask 4.3: Log (as per AC9) when BBCode tags are encountered and stripped, particularly if complex or unsupported tags are found.
- [x] Task 5: **Implement Whitespace Normalization (AC: 5)**
  - [x] Subtask 5.1: After HTML and BBCode removal, process the text to normalize whitespace.
  - [x] Subtask 5.2: Collapse multiple consecutive spaces, tabs, and newlines into a single space or a single newline where appropriate to maintain readability without excessive whitespace.
- [x] Task 6: **Integrate and Ensure Final Output (AC: 6, 8)**
  - [x] Subtask 6.1: Ensure `CleanNewTextBlock` returns the processed plain text.
  - [x] Subtask 6.2: The function should be callable by the logic in Story 3.3/3.5 when a `new_text` block's content needs to be prepared for the JSON.
- [x] Task 7: **Implement Error Handling and Logging (AC: 7, 9)**
  - [x] Subtask 7.1: Implement robust error handling within `CleanNewTextBlock` for issues like malformed HTML or BBCode.
  - [x] Subtask 7.2: Log errors as per `docs/operational-guidelines.md#4.4.-Logging-Protocols`, attempting to return as much cleaned text as possible rather than failing completely on minor issues.
  - [x] Subtask 7.3: Ensure logging for specific cases like unhandled image tags or BBCode (AC9) is implemented.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Primary File:** `pkg/parser/content_parser.go` (or a new `pkg/parser/text_cleaner.go`).
- **Function Signature:** `func CleanNewTextBlock(rawHTML string) (cleanedText string, err error)`
- **HTML Parsing:**
    - For stripping general HTML tags, `golang.org/x/net/html` can be used to walk the node tree and accumulate text content.
    - Alternatively, a simpler approach for basic tag stripping could be a regex, but this is generally less robust than a proper parser. Given the need to inspect `<img>` tag attributes, a proper parser is recommended.
- **BBCode Parsing:**
    - Regular expressions are likely sufficient for the common BBCode tags listed. Ensure regexes are well-tested for edge cases (e.g., nested tags if they need to be handled, though simple stripping is the primary goal).
    - Example BBCode to handle:
        - `[b]bold text[/b]` -> `bold text`
        - `[i]italic text[/i]` -> `italic text`
        - `[url=http://example.com]Example Link[/url]` -> `Example Link`
        - `[url]http://example.com[/url]` -> `http://example.com` (or decide if this form should also be stripped to its content)
        - `[img]http://example.com/image.jpg[/img]` -> Should be handled carefully. If these are not emojis, they might need a placeholder like `[image]` or be removed. AC2 focuses on `<img>` HTML tags for emojis. Clarify if BBCode `[img]` tags are common and how they should be treated if not emojis. For now, assume they are to be stripped or replaced with a placeholder.
- **Line Breaks:** Pay attention to how `goquery` or `net/html` treats line breaks. `<br>` tags are explicit. Text content within different block elements might implicitly be separated by newlines by browsers; the cleaning process should try to emulate this for readability.
- **Whitespace:** The `strings` package in Go has useful functions for trimming and replacing whitespace. `strings.Fields` and `strings.Join` can be helpful for normalizing space between words.
- **Dependencies:** This story relies on the output of Story 3.3, which identifies `new_text` blocks. The `CleanNewTextBlock` function will process the raw HTML content of these blocks.
- **Error Handling:** Refer to `docs/operational-guidelines.md#4.4.-Logging-Protocols`. Log warnings for recoverable issues during cleaning and errors for more significant problems, but aim to return partially cleaned text if possible.
- **Idempotency:** The cleaning function should ideally be idempotent (applying it multiple times to already cleaned text should not change the output further, or only in predictable normalization ways).
