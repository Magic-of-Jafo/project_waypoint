Title: Orchestrate Full Structured Data Extraction Run with Resumability and Logging
Status: Done
Priority: High
---

## Story

- As the Structured Data Extraction System,
- I want to read the master list of topics to be processed (derived from Epic 1's index and Epic 2's archive), systematically iterate through these topics, orchestrate the structured data extraction and saving process for each one (using Story 3.5's logic), maintain a persistent state of overall progress, and provide comprehensive logging of the entire run,
- So that the full Epic 3 process can be reliably executed, stopped and resumed, monitored, and its outcome (which topics were processed, which failed) is fully traceable.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

AC1: The system MUST be configurable with the path to the input list of topics to be processed (e.g., a file generated or used by Epic 2 detailing all successfully archived topics).
AC2: The system MUST successfully read and parse the input list of topics, identifying all unique topic_ids to process.
AC3: The system MUST maintain a persistent state file that records which topic_ids have been successfully processed and saved as JSON files.
AC4: Upon starting, the system MUST check for the existence of the state file. If found, it MUST automatically load the state and resume processing from the next unprocessed topic_id in the input list.
AC5: For each topic_id in the list (skipping those marked as complete in the state file), the system MUST invoke the logic to process that topic and save its JSON file (as defined in Story 3.5).
AC6: If processing a topic (via Story 3.5) is successful, the system MUST update its persistent state to mark that topic_id as completed. The state file MUST be updated frequently (e.g., after each topic, or in batches) to minimize rework on resume.
AC7: If processing a topic (via Story 3.5 AC15) fails irrevocably after internal retries/error handling, the system MUST log this failure clearly (including the topic_id) but continue processing the next topic in the list. These failed topics should ideally be recorded in a separate log or section of the state file for later review.
AC8: The system MUST provide comprehensive operational logging for the entire run, detailing:
    - Start time and configured parameters.
    - Confirmation of resuming from a state file, if applicable, and the point of resumption.
    - The total number of topics identified for processing.
    - Start and end of processing for each topic.
    - Success confirmation for each topic, including the saved filename.
    - Clear logging of any topics skipped (due to prior completion or failure).
    - Logging of progress statistics (e.g., "Processed X of Y topics", estimated time remaining for the overall run - similar to Epic 2's ETC, though maybe simpler here).
    - Clear logging of any errors and warnings propagated from Story 3.5.
    - A final summary upon completion (total processed, total failed).
AC9: The system MUST be designed to be stoppable (e.g., via OS signals like SIGTERM if running in a container) and resume cleanly from the last saved state upon restart.
AC10: The state file format and saving mechanism MUST be robust to prevent corruption during abrupt interruptions.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [X] Task 1: **Define Orchestration Configuration and Input (AC1, AC2)**
    - [X] Subtask 1.1: Define a configuration structure for the orchestrator (e.g., input topic list path, archive path, output JSON path, state file path).
    - [X] Subtask 1.2: Implement logic to load and parse the input topic list (e.g., a CSV or JSON file mapping topic ID to subforum ID).
- [ ] Task 2: **Implement State Management (AC3, AC4, AC6, AC10)**
    - [X] Subtask 2.1: Design the structure for the state file (e.g., JSON object mapping topic IDs to "completed" or "failed" status).
    - [X] Subtask 2.2: Implement `LoadState(stateFilePath string) (map[string]string, error)` function.
    - [X] Subtask 2.3: Implement `SaveState(stateFilePath string, state map[string]string) error` function, ensuring atomic/robust writes.
    - [X] Subtask 2.4: Implement logic to update the state after each successful topic processing or batch.
- [X] Task 3: **Implement Main Orchestration Loop (AC4, AC5, AC7)**
    - [X] Subtask 3.1: Create the main orchestrator function (e.g., `RunExtractionOrchestrator(config OrchestratorConfig)`).
    - [X] Subtask 3.2: Iterate through the list of topics from Task 1.2.
    - [X] Subtask 3.3: For each topic, check its status in the loaded state (from Task 2.2). Skip if already "completed".
    - [X] Subtask 3.4: Invoke Story 3.5's `ProcessTopic` function for each pending topic.
    - [X] Subtask 3.5: If `ProcessTopic` is successful, update state to "completed" (Task 2.4).
    - [X] Subtask 3.6: If `ProcessTopic` fails, log the failure and update state to "failed" (or similar) for that topic, then continue to the next.
- [X] Task 4: **Implement Comprehensive Logging (AC8)**
    - [X] Subtask 4.1: Integrate a logging library (e.g., standard `log` or a structured logger like `logrus` or `zap`).
    - [X] Subtask 4.2: Implement logging for start/end of run, configuration parameters.
    - [X] Subtask 4.3: Log state loading/resumption details.
    - [X] Subtask 4.4: Log start/end/success/failure for each topic processed.
    - [X] Subtask 4.5: Implement progress statistics logging (X of Y topics, ETC if feasible).

- [X] Task 5: **Implement Stoppability/Resumability (AC9)**
    - [X] Subtask 5.1: Design the system to handle OS interrupt signals gracefully (e.g., `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`).
    - [X] Subtask 5.2: Ensure state is saved promptly upon receiving a signal before exiting.
- [X] Task 6: **Unit Testing**
    - [X] Subtask 6.1: Write unit tests for state loading and saving.

    - [X] Subtask 6.3: Test scenarios: fresh run, resume from partial run, run with topic failures, empty topic list.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Primary File(s):** A new file, e.g., `cmd/tmc-data-extractor/main.go` or `pkg/orchestrator/orchestrator.go`.
- **Key Functions to Implement:**
    - `RunExtractionOrchestrator(config OrchestratorConfig)`
    - `LoadState(stateFilePath string) (map[string]string, error)`
    - `SaveState(stateFilePath string, state map[string]string) error`
- **Data Structures:**
    - `OrchestratorConfig` struct.
    - Map for state: `map[string]string` (e.g., `topicID: "completed" | "failed" | "pending"`).
- **Dependencies:**
    - This story will call the `ProcessTopic` function developed in Story 3.5.
    - Standard Go libraries: `os`, `os/signal`, `syscall`, `encoding/json`, `log`, `path/filepath`.
    - Consider a robust file writing library for atomic state saves if not handling manually.
- **Configuration:**
    - Input topic list path.
    - Path to the Waypoint Archive (passed to Story 3.5).
    - Output directory for JSON files (passed to Story 3.5).
    - State file path.
    - Logging level/output.
- **Error Handling:**
    - Follow `docs/operational-guidelines.md#4.4.-Logging-Protocols`.
    - Distinguish between errors that fail a single topic (should be logged, state updated, continue) and errors that should halt the orchestrator (e.g., cannot read input topic list, cannot write state).
- **Input Topic List Format:**
    - Decide on a simple, parseable format for the list of topics, e.g., a JSON array of objects `[{"topic_id": "123", "subforum_id": "45"}, ...]` or a CSV file. The `subforum_id` is needed by `ProcessTopic` (as per Story 3.5 guidance) to construct the output filename.
- **State File Atomicity:**
    - Critical for resumability. Writing to a temporary file then renaming is a common pattern to ensure the state file isn't corrupted if the process dies mid-write.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used:
Gemini 2.5 Pro (via Cursor)

### Completion Notes List
- **Troubleshooting and Fixes for Orchestrator Tests:**
  - Addressed and resolved test failures within the `pkg/orchestrator` package. The fixes ensure more robust test mocks and more resilient error handling in the topic processing logic. All tests in this package are now passing.
  - **Key Issues Identified and Resolved:**
    1.  **`TestRunExtractionOrchestrator` Failures:**
        *   **Issue:** Several tests (e.g., `FreshRun_AllSuccess`, `ResumeRun_PartialSuccessAndFailure`) were failing due to mock HTML in `setupMockArchiveForTopics` (`pkg/orchestrator/orchestrator_test.go`) missing the CSS selector (`div.vt1.liketext > div.like_right > span[id^=p_]`) required by `extractorlogic.ExtractPostMetadata` for post IDs.
        *   **Fix:** Updated `mockHTMLContent` in `setupMockArchiveForTopics` to include the correct HTML structure, aligning mocks with parser expectations.
    2.  **`TestProcessTopic/Topic_with_partial_extraction_errors` Failure:**
        *   **Issue:** This test (`pkg/orchestrator/topic_processor_test.go`) failed because `ProcessTopic` (in `pkg/orchestrator/topic_processor.go`) treated individual post metadata extraction errors as fatal. The test expected graceful error handling for specific posts while continuing topic processing.
        *   **Fix:** Modified `ProcessTopic` error handling. When `extractorlogic.ExtractPostMetadata` fails for a post, the error is logged as a warning, and processing `continue`s to the next post, preventing a single problematic post from halting entire topic processing.
  - **Outcome:** All tests in `project-waypoint/pkg/orchestrator/...` now pass. The orchestrator's testing framework is more accurate, and topic processing is more resilient.

### Change Log
- YYYY-MM-DD: Initial draft by BMad Scrum Master Agent.
- 2025-05-31: Updated status to Done. Added completion notes regarding orchestrator test troubleshooting and fixes. Corrected mock HTML in `orchestrator_test.go` and error handling in `topic_processor.go` to allow continuation on partial post extraction failures. All orchestrator tests are now passing.
