Title: Process Complete Topic and Save Structured JSON File
Status: Done
Priority: High
---

## Story

- As the Structured Data Extraction System,
- I want to take a specific Topic ID, process all of its archived HTML pages (from Epic 2), extract and assemble the structured data for every post within that topic, and save the complete topic's data into a single JSON file using the defined naming convention,
- So that the "Waypoint Archive" contains a structured, machine-readable JSON file for every topic, ready for use in Phase 4.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

AC1: The system MUST accept a topic_id as input, and be able to identify and retrieve all archived HTML files corresponding to that topic (across all pages) from the local archive structure (leveraging knowledge from Epic 2's output).
AC2: The system MUST iterate through the HTML files for all pages of the given topic in the correct page order.
AC3: For each HTML page within the topic, the system MUST perform the steps defined in previous stories: read the HTML (Story 3.1 AC1-AC8), identify individual post blocks (Story 3.1 AC4-AC6).
AC4: For each identified post block on every page, the system MUST extract its core metadata (Story 3.2 AC1-AC9).
AC5: For each post block, the system MUST parse its content into structured blocks (new text/quotes) and extract quote details (Combined Story 3.3 AC1-AC10).
AC6: For each new_text block, the system MUST extract the clean text content (Story 3.4 AC1-AC9).
AC7: For each post, the system MUST assemble all the extracted metadata, clean text content, and structured quote data into a single data structure conforming to the agreed-upon JSON schema for a post.
AC8: The system MUST collect all the assembled post data structures for all posts from all pages belonging to the current topic.
AC9: The system MUST structure the collected post data for the topic. This could be an array of post JSON objects at the top level, potentially within a topic-level object that includes topic_id and subforum_id for easy reference within the file itself.
AC10: The system MUST save the final, assembled structured data for the entire topic into a single file.
AC11: The saved file MUST be in valid JSON format.
AC12: The filename MUST adhere to the specified convention: {subforum_id}_{topic_id}.json, and the file should be saved to a user-configurable output directory on the Synology NAS.
AC13: The system MUST implement robust error handling throughout the topic processing (reading pages, parsing posts, extracting data, assembling), logging errors (e.g., failed pages, posts with partial data) but attempting to complete the topic file where possible.
AC14: Upon successful completion for a topic, the system MUST log a confirmation message including the path to the saved JSON file and the number of posts processed for that topic.
AC15: If processing a topic fails irrevocably (e.g., cannot read essential pages), the system MUST log this failure clearly, indicating the problematic topic.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: **Define Topic Processing Orchestration Logic (AC1, AC2)**
    - [x] Subtask 1.1: Design a function/method, e.g., `ProcessTopic(topicID string, archivePath string, outputPath string) error` in a relevant package (e.g., `pkg/orchestrator`).
    - [x] Subtask 1.2: Implement logic to identify all HTML files for the given `topicID` within the `archivePath` based on Epic 2's structure (e.g., `{ARCHIVE_ROOT}/{sub_forum_id_or_name}/{topic_id}/page_{page_number}.html`).
    - [x] Subtask 1.3: Ensure page files are processed in ascending order of `page_number`.
- [x] Task 2: **Integrate Post Identification and Metadata Extraction (AC3, AC4)**
    - [x] Subtask 2.1: For each page, use the functionality from Story 3.1 (e.g., `IdentifyPostBlocks(htmlContent string) ([]HTMLBlock, error)`) to get individual post HTML.
    - [x] Subtask 2.2: For each post block, use the functionality from Story 3.2 (e.g., `ExtractPostMetadata(postHTML HTMLBlock, topicContext Context) (PostMetadata, error)`) to get metadata.
- [x] Task 3: **Integrate Content Parsing and Cleaning (AC5, AC6)**
    - [x] Subtask 3.1: For each post block, use the functionality from Story 3.3 (e.g., `ParsePostContent(postHTML HTMLBlock) ([]ContentBlock, error)`) to get structured content blocks.
    - [x] Subtask 3.2: For each `new_text` content block, use the functionality from Story 3.4 (e.g., `CleanNewTextBlock(rawHTML string) (string, error)`) to get clean text.
- [x] Task 4: **Assemble Post Data into Final JSON Structure (AC7, AC8, AC9)**
    - [x] Subtask 4.1: Define the Go struct that matches the target JSON schema for a single post (referencing `docs/epic-3.md#Target-Structured-Data-Format-JSON-Schema-for-a-single-Post`).
    - [x] Subtask 4.2: For each post, populate this struct using data from Task 2 (metadata) and Task 3 (content blocks with cleaned text). Remember to include `post_url` construction.
    - [x] Subtask 4.3: Collect all post structs for the current topic into a slice/array.
    - [x] Subtask 4.4: Decide on the top-level JSON structure for the topic file (e.g., array of posts, or an object containing topic metadata and the array of posts).
- [x] Task 5: **Implement JSON File Saving and Naming (AC10, AC11, AC12)**
    - [x] Subtask 5.1: Implement logic to marshal the collected post data for the topic into a JSON string.
    - [x] Subtask 5.2: Ensure the output is valid JSON.
    - [x] Subtask 5.3: Construct the filename: `{subforum_id}_{topic_id}.json`. The `subforum_id` should be derivable from context (e.g., archive path or topic metadata).
    - [x] Subtask 5.4: Save the JSON string to the specified `outputPath` with the correct filename. Ensure the output directory is configurable.
- [x] Task 6: **Implement Error Handling and Logging for Topic Processing (AC13, AC14, AC15)**
    - [x] Subtask 6.1: Implement comprehensive error handling within `ProcessTopic`. Log errors encountered during page reading, post parsing, data extraction, and JSON serialization.
    - [x] Subtask 6.2: If a page or post fails, log the issue and attempt to continue with the next item, collecting partial data if possible for the topic.
    - [x] Subtask 6.3: Log a success message upon completing a topic, including the output file path and post count (AC14).
    - [x] Subtask 6.4: If a topic fails fatally (e.g., cannot find any pages), log this clearly (AC15).
- [x] Task 7: **Unit Testing**
    - [x] Subtask 7.1: Write unit tests for `ProcessTopic`, mocking dependencies (file system interaction, previous stories' functions).
    - [x] Subtask 7.2: Test scenarios: successful topic processing, topic with missing pages, topic with posts that cause parsing errors, empty topic.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Primary File(s):** Likely a new file in `pkg/orchestrator/` (e.g., `topic_processor.go`) or similar.
- **Key Functions to Implement:**
    - `ProcessTopic(topicID string, archivePath string, outputPath string, topicMetadata TopicInfo) error` (or similar signature, `TopicInfo` could carry `subforum_id`).
    - Helper functions for file discovery, JSON marshalling, etc.
- **Data Structures:**
    - Define Go structs for the final JSON output, matching the schema in `docs/epic-3.md`.
- **Dependencies:**
    - This story will call functions/use logic developed in Stories 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4.
    - Standard Go libraries for file system interaction (`os`, `filepath`), JSON (`encoding/json`).
- **Configuration:**
    - The root path for the Waypoint Archive (input) and the output directory for JSON files MUST be configurable. This might be passed into `ProcessTopic` or managed at a higher orchestrator level (Story 3.6).
- **Error Handling:**
    - Follow `docs/operational-guidelines.md#4.4.-Logging-Protocols`.
    - Aim for resilience: partial success (e.g., saving a topic JSON even if a few posts within it had minor issues) is preferable to total failure for the topic if significant data can still be extracted.
- **JSON Schema Adherence:**
    - Strictly follow the JSON schema defined in `docs/epic-3.md` for the output files.
    - Pay attention to `post_url` construction. The epic mentions "url_to_this_specific_post_if_available_or_page_url". Decide on a consistent strategy.
    - `topic_id` and `subforum_id` need to be consistently derived and included in the post JSON objects.
