# Story 3.2: Extract Core Post Metadata

## Status: Done

## Story

- As the Structured Data Extraction System,
- I want to take the isolated HTML block for a single post (identified in Story 3.1) and reliably extract its core metadata fields: post_id, topic_id, subforum_id, page_number, post_order_on_page, author_username, and timestamp,
- So that this essential identifying and contextual information is available for inclusion in the final structured JSON output for that post.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

AC1: Given the HTML content corresponding to a single post block, the system MUST accurately extract the author_username.
AC2: The system MUST accurately extract and parse the timestamp of the post into a consistent format (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS") from the post's HTML.
AC3: The system MUST accurately extract the post_id using the value found in the id attribute of the relevant HTML element (e.g., the number from id="p_4174478").
AC4: The system MUST accurately extract the post_order_on_page using the value found in the name attribute of the relevant HTML anchor tag (e.g., the number from <a name="0"></a>).
AC5: The system MUST determine the topic_id for the post. This might be extracted from the original filename of the HTML page or passed in from the process orchestrating the parsing (linking back to Epic 2's file structure).
AC6: The system MUST determine the subforum_id for the post. Similar to topic_id, this is likely derived from the filename, file path, or passed in context from the Epic 2 archive structure.
AC7: The system MUST determine the page_number for the post. This is also likely derived from the filename or passed in context (linking back to Epic 2's file structure).
AC8: The system MUST handle variations in HTML structure or missing elements for these metadata fields gracefully, logging warnings or errors but attempting to extract as much information as possible and ideally marking the specific post as having potential metadata extraction issues rather than halting the entire process.
AC9: The extracted metadata fields for a post MUST be made available in a structured format (e.g., a map or object in Go/Python) to be used in subsequent steps (like assembling the final JSON).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: **Define Post Metadata Structure (AC: 9)**
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Define a Go struct (e.g., `PostMetadata`) in `pkg/data/types.go` to hold all fields: `PostID` (string), `TopicID` (string), `SubForumID` (string), `PageNumber` (int), `PostOrderOnPage` (int), `AuthorUsername` (string), `Timestamp` (string - formatted "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS").
- [x] Task 2: **Implement Author Username Extraction (AC: 1, 8)**
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: In `pkg/parser/parser.go` (or a new `metadata_extractor.go` in `pkg/extractorlogic`), create a function `ExtractAuthorUsername(postHTMLBlock *goquery.Document) (string, error)` that takes a `goquery` document representing a single post block.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Identify the CSS selector(s) to reliably locate the author's username within the post HTML.
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Implement logic to extract the text content of the username.
  - [x] Subtask 2.4: Implement error/warning logging if the username element is not found or is malformed, returning an empty string and/or error as appropriate.
- [x] Task 3: **Implement Timestamp Extraction and Parsing (AC: 2, 8)**
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: In the same parser/extractor file, create `ExtractTimestamp(postHTMLBlock *goquery.Document) (string, error)`.
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Identify CSS selector(s) for the timestamp element.
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Extract the raw timestamp string.
  - [x] Subtask 3.4: Parse the raw string (e.g., "Posted: May 27, 2025, 10:30 AM") into "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" format. Use Go's `time` package.
  - [x] Subtask 3.5: Implement error/warning logging for parsing failures or missing elements.
- [x] Task 4: **Implement Post ID Extraction (AC: 3, 8)**
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Create `ExtractPostID(postHTMLBlock *goquery.Document) (string, error)`.
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Identify the HTML element (likely a `<span>` or `<a>`) and attribute (e.g., `id="p_12345"`) for the post ID.
  - [x] Subtask 4.3: Extract the numeric part of the ID.
  - [x] Subtask 4.4: Implement error/warning logging.
- [x] Task 5: **Implement Post Order on Page Extraction (AC: 4, 8)**
  - [x] Subtask 5.1: Create `ExtractPostOrderOnPage(postHTMLBlock *goquery.Document) (int, error)`.
  - [x] Subtask 5.2: Identify the HTML anchor tag (e.g., `<a name="0">`) for post order.
  - [x] Subtask 5.3: Extract and convert the numeric value.
  - [x] Subtask 5.4: Implement error/warning logging.
- [x] Task 6: **Determine Contextual Metadata (TopicID, SubForumID, PageNumber) (AC: 5, 6, 7)**
  - [x] Subtask 6.1: Design the main extraction function in `pkg/extractorlogic/extractor.go` (e.g., `ExtractPostMetadata(postHTMLBlock *goquery.Document, filePath string) (PostMetadata, error)`) to accept the `filePath` of the source HTML file.
  - [x] Subtask 6.2: Implement logic to parse `TopicID`, `SubForumID`, and `PageNumber` from the `filePath` string, based on the archive structure defined in Epic 2 (e.g., `{ARCHIVE_ROOT}/{sub_forum_id_or_name}/{topic_id}/page_{page_number}.html`).
  - [x] Subtask 6.3: Populate these fields in the `PostMetadata` struct.
- [x] Task 7: **Integrate Metadata Extraction (AC: 9)**
  - [x] Subtask 7.1: The `ExtractPostMetadata` function (from Subtask 6.1) should call the individual extraction functions (Tasks 2-5) and assemble the complete `PostMetadata` struct.
  - [x] Subtask 7.2: Ensure comprehensive error handling and aggregation from sub-functions.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Primary Files:**
  - `pkg/data/types.go`: For `PostMetadata` struct.
  - `pkg/parser/parser.go` or `pkg/extractorlogic/metadata_extractor.go`: For HTML parsing functions using `goquery`.
  - `pkg/extractorlogic/extractor.go`: For the main orchestrating function that uses file path context.
- **HTML Selectors:** Detailed analysis of sample `page_X.html` files from the archive (created by Epic 2) will be required to determine the precise CSS selectors for `author_username`, `timestamp`, `post_id` (e.g., `id="p_XXXX"`), and `post_order_on_page` (e.g., `<a name="N">`). Refer to findings from Story 3.1 if available (e.g., notes on specific `<table>` or `<div>` structures containing posts).
- **Timestamp Parsing:** The Magic Cafe timestamps (e.g., "Posted: May 26, 2025, 09:27 AM", "Today at 09:27 AM", "Yesterday at 02:10 PM") will require flexible parsing. Go's `time.Parse` with multiple layouts might be needed. Consider handling relative terms like "Today" and "Yesterday" by using the file's modification date or a known processing date as a reference if the absolute date isn't in the timestamp string itself for those cases. However, most forum timestamps are absolute.
- **Contextual Metadata:** The file path `{ARCHIVE_ROOT}/{sub_forum_id_or_name}/{topic_id}/page_{page_number}.html` is the primary source for `topic_id`, `subforum_id` (or name, which might need mapping if an ID is strictly required by `PostMetadata`), and `page_number`. Robust string splitting or regex will be needed.
- **Error Handling:** Adhere to `docs/operational-guidelines.md` for error handling and logging. Return errors from functions and log warnings/errors within functions if extraction of a specific field fails but others might succeed (AC8). The main orchestrating function should decide if an overall error is returned or a partially populated struct with logged issues.
- **JSON Schema Reminder (from PRD/Epic 3):**
  ```json
  {
    "post_id": "unique_id_from_span_id",
    "topic_id": "the_topic_id_this_post_belongs_to",
    "subforum_id": "the_subforum_id_this_post_belongs_to",
    "page_number": 1,
    "post_order_on_page": 0,
    "author_username": "Username",
    "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
    // content_blocks will be handled in a subsequent story
  }
  ```

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `<Agent Model Name/Version>`

### Dev Review Notes
- **Overall Clarity:** The story is well-defined, and the ACs are clear. The tasks are broken down logically.
- **Contextual Metadata (AC5, AC6, AC7 & Task 6):** The reliance on file path parsing (`{ARCHIVE_ROOT}/{sub_forum_id_or_name}/{topic_id}/page_{page_number}.html`) for `TopicID`, `SubForumID`, and `PageNumber` is clear. The note about potentially mapping `sub_forum_id_or_name` to an ID if `PostMetadata` strictly requires an ID is important. I will assume for now that the string name is acceptable or that a mapping mechanism will be provided if an ID is mandatory.
- **Timestamp Parsing (Task 3.4):** The guidance on handling "Today" and "Yesterday" is noted. This will require careful implementation, possibly using a reference timestamp (e.g., file processing date) if the absolute date isn't directly available in those cases. The primary approach will be to parse absolute timestamps first.
- **Post ID Extraction (Task 4):** The subtasks are marked as complete, but the parent Task 4 is not. I will assume the subtasks' completion means Task 4 is effectively done.
- **Task 6 & 7 status:** Task 6 "Determine Contextual Metadata" and Task 7 "Integrate Metadata Extraction" are not marked as complete, but their subtasks are all checked. I will assume these parent tasks are also complete.
- **Error Handling (AC8):** The requirement to log warnings/errors and attempt to extract as much as possible, marking specific posts with issues rather than halting, is clear and will be followed.
- **Dependencies:** The story correctly identifies dependencies on Story 3.1 and Epic 2.
- **JSON Schema:** The target JSON schema is clear.
- **Checklist:** The "Story Draft Checklist Report" is complete and passed. I will need to complete the "Story DoD Checklist" as part of my work.

My understanding is that I need to:
1.  Implement the logic for tasks that are not yet fully complete (though most seem to be, based on subtask completion).
2.  Ensure all ACs are met.
3.  Pay close attention to timestamp parsing and contextual metadata extraction from file paths.
4.  Implement robust error handling.
5.  Complete the "Story DoD Checklist Report" before marking the story for final review.
