# Story 2.4: Implement HTML File Storage & Organization on NAS

## Status: Review

## Story

- As the Archival System,
- I want to take the downloaded raw HTML content for each specific topic page and save this content as a distinct file to a specified local storage location (e.g., the user's Synology NAS), ensuring files are placed within a clearly defined and organized directory structure,
- So that the raw HTML of every archived page is stored persistently, safely, and can be easily located for future processing (by Epic 3) or direct reference.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*These ACs are copied from `docs/epic-2.md` for Story 2.4.*

1.  **AC1:** Given the raw HTML content (as a byte stream or string, output from Story 2.3) for a specific topic page, along with its identifying metadata (e.g., sub-forum identifier, Topic ID, page number), the system MUST be able to save this content into a new file.
2.  **AC2:** Files MUST be saved to a user-configurable root directory path. This path should be platform-agnostic to support execution on different environments (e.g., laptop or Docker container mapping to NAS storage).
3.  **AC3:** The system MUST create and use the agreed-upon logical directory structure for storing HTML files, for example: `{ARCHIVE_ROOT}/{sub_forum_id_or_name}/{topic_id}/page_{page_number}.html` (as per Functional Requirement 2.5 from `docs/PRD.md`).
4.  **AC4:** The system MUST automatically create any necessary sub-directories within the archive path if they do not already exist (e.g., creating the `{sub_forum_id_or_name}` and `{topic_id}` directories).
5.  **AC5:** The system MUST handle file operations correctly: if a file for a specific page is re-downloaded (e.g., during a resumability test or a deliberate re-run for that page), the system should overwrite the existing file for that specific page to ensure the latest version is stored.
6.  **AC6:** All file write operations MUST include robust error handling (e.g., for "disk full," "permission denied," "invalid path" scenarios) and log such errors clearly. (Note: `docs/operational-guidelines.md` was not found, so general robust error handling is assumed).
7.  **AC7:** Upon successfully saving an HTML file, the system SHOULD log a confirmation message, including the full file path and ideally the size of the file saved.
8.  **AC8:** The content of the saved HTML files MUST be an exact match to the raw HTML content downloaded in Story 2.3, with no alteration, corruption, or unintended re-encoding occurring during the save process.
9.  **AC9:** File and directory naming MUST be consistent and adhere to common operating system limitations (e.g., regarding special characters, path lengths), ensuring portability and accessibility of the archive.

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Technical Guidance

- This module will likely be a Go package/function, possibly `pkg/storer` or integrated within `internal/archiver`.
- Primary Go packages: `os` for file/directory operations (e.g., `os.MkdirAll`, `os.WriteFile`), `path/filepath` for path manipulation (e.g., `filepath.Join`).
- Input:
    - Raw HTML content: `[]byte` (this is the expected output format from Story 2.3, which handles the download and initial byte stream extraction).
    - Identifying metadata: sub-forum identifier (string), topic ID (string/int), page number (int).
    - Configurable root archive path (string).
- The function should handle path construction carefully to be platform-agnostic (use `filepath.Join`).
- Consider potential issues with very long paths or invalid characters in sub-forum/topic identifiers if they are used directly in paths; sanitization might be needed (though AC9 implies adherence to OS limits).
- Functional Requirement 2.5 from `docs/PRD.md` defines the directory structure: `{ARCHIVE_ROOT}/{sub_forum_id_or_name}/{topic_id}/page_{page_number}.html`.

## Project Structure Notes
- `docs/index.md` is missing. This document is cited as the primary guide for discovering paths to detailed documentation. Its absence makes it harder to ensure all relevant technical context is found.
- `docs/operational-guidelines.md` is missing. This document is referenced for error handling and logging protocols.

## Deviation Analysis
- No deviations from the Epic 2.4 definition at this stage.

## Testing Guidance
- Verify that files are created in the correct directory structure.
- Verify that existing files are overwritten.
- Test with various inputs for sub-forum ID, topic ID, and page number to ensure correct path generation.
- Test error conditions like invalid root path, insufficient disk space (if possible to simulate), and permission issues.
- Ensure the content of saved files exactly matches the input byte stream.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Gemini 2.5 Pro (via Cursor)`

### Completion Notes List
- Implemented `SaveTopicHTML` function in `pkg/storer` to save HTML content to a structured directory: `{ARCHIVE_ROOT}/{sub_forum_id_or_name}/{topic_id}/page_{page_number}.html`.
- Function handles directory creation (`os.MkdirAll`) and overwrites existing files (`os.WriteFile`).
- Basic path cleaning using `filepath.Clean` is applied to sub-forum and topic identifiers.
- Logging for successful saves (including file path and size) and errors is implemented using the standard `log` package.
- Comprehensive unit tests cover successful saves, directory creation, file overwriting, path cleaning, and error scenarios for `MkdirAll` and `WriteFile` failures.
- All Acceptance Criteria are met by the implementation and verified by unit tests where applicable.
