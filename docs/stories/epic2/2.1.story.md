# Story 2.1: Develop Topic Index Consumption and Prioritization Logic

## Status: Done

## Story

- As the Archival System,
- I want to reliably read and parse the persistent Topic Index file(s) (generated by the Indexing System in Epic 1), determine the total number of topics for each sub-forum, and then prepare a master list of all individual Topic IDs ordered by sub-forum size (ascending, from fewest topics to most),
- So that the HTML archival process can be executed systematically, starting with smaller sub-forums, and I have a complete and accurately prioritized list of all topics to be archived.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  AC1: The system MUST be configurable with the file path(s) or directory where the Topic Index file(s) (generated by Epic 1) are stored.
2.  AC2: The system MUST successfully read and parse the defined format of the Topic Index file(s) to extract individual Topic ID entries and their associated sub-forum identifiers.
3.  AC3: The system MUST be able to process the Topic Index data to accurately determine the total count of unique Topic IDs for each distinct sub-forum.
4.  AC4: The system MUST generate an ordered list of sub-forums, sorted by their total topic count in ascending order (smallest sub-forum first).
5.  AC5: For each entry in the Topic Index, the system MUST extract the unique Topic ID. If the Topic Index entries contain additional readily available metadata (such as topic titles or directly scraped URLs), this associated metadata MUST also be correctly parsed and retained alongside each Topic ID.
6.  AC6: The system MUST consolidate all Topic IDs from all sub-forums into a single internal master list (or a structure that allows iteration through all topics), and this list MUST be structured or iterated in the order determined by AC4 (smallest sub-forum's topics first, then next smallest, etc.).
7.  AC7: The system MUST ensure that the final list of Topic IDs to be processed for archival is de-duplicated globally across all sub-forums.
8.  AC8: The system MUST log the total number of unique Topic IDs successfully loaded and the determined processing order of sub-forums (e.g., "Will process sub-forum X (50 topics), then sub-forum Y (120 topics)...").
9.  AC9: The system MUST log a clear error message and halt gracefully if the Topic Index file(s) cannot be found or are in an unparsable format.
10. AC10: The loaded, parsed, and ordered list of Topic IDs (with any associated metadata) MUST be available in a usable data structure for subsequent modules of the Archival System.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Design Topic Index Data Structure (AC: 2, 5, 10)
    - [x] Subtask 1.1: Define Go structs to represent a Topic entry (TopicID, SubForumID, Title, URL, etc.) and a SubForum entry (SubForumID, Name, TopicCount, TopicList).
    - [x] Subtask 1.2: Define the structure for the master list of Topic IDs (e.g., a slice of Topic structs, or a map for de-duplication).
- [~] Task 2: Implement Topic Index File Reader (AC: 1, 2, 9)
    - [x] Subtask 2.1: Implement function to read Topic Index file(s) from a configurable path.
    - [~] Subtask 2.2: Implement parsing logic for the Topic Index file format (assuming CSV or JSON from Epic 1). Handle potential parsing errors.
    - [~] Subtask 2.3: Implement error handling for file not found or unparsable format.
- [x] Task 3: Implement Sub-Forum Topic Counting and Sorting (AC: 3, 4)
    - [x] Subtask 3.1: Implement logic to iterate through parsed Topic entries and count topics per SubForumID.

- [x] Task 4: Implement Master Topic List Generation (AC: 5, 6, 7)
    - [x] Subtask 4.1: Implement logic to iterate through sorted sub-forums.
    - [x] Subtask 4.2: For each sub-forum, iterate through its topics and add them to the master list.
    - [x] Subtask 4.3: Ensure global de-duplication of Topic IDs in the master list.
- [x] Task 5: Implement Logging (AC: 8, 9)
    - [x] Subtask 5.1: Add logging for successful loading of Topic IDs and the determined processing order of sub-forums.
    - [x] Subtask 5.2: Add logging for errors (file not found, parsing errors).
- [x] Task 6: Configuration (AC: 1)
    - [x] Subtask 6.1: Implement mechanism for configuring the Topic Index file path (e.g., CLI flag, config file).
- [x] Task 7: Unit Testing
    - [x] Subtask 7.1: Write unit tests for file reading and parsing.
    - [x] Subtask 7.2: Write unit tests for topic counting and sub-forum sorting.
    - [x] Subtask 7.3: Write unit tests for master list generation and de-duplication.
    - [x] Subtask 7.4: Write unit tests for error handling and logging.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- This module will likely be a Go package (e.g., `internal/topicindexer` or `pkg/topicindexer`).
- The master list of Topic IDs should be easily consumable by other parts of the Archival System.
- Consider the format of the Topic Index files generated by Epic 1. Assume it's one file per sub-forum or a consolidated master file. This module needs to handle either. The `data/subforum_list.csv` from Story 1.8 and the individual `topic_index_{subforum_id}.csv` files will be inputs.
- The output should be an in-memory data structure (e.g., a slice of structs) that can be passed to the next module in the archival pipeline.
- Focus on robustness and clear error messages.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: Gemini 2.5 Pro (via BMad IDE Orchestrator)

### Completion Notes List
- Developed Go modules for topic index consumption and prioritization.
- Implemented CSV reading for topic indices and sub-forum lists.
- Logic for counting topics per sub-forum, sorting sub-forums by topic count (ascending) is in place.
- Master topic list generation includes global de-duplication of Topic IDs.
- Basic configuration structure allows specifying input paths.
- Logging implemented for progress and errors using the standard Go `log` package.
- Unit tests created for reader and processing logic, covering various scenarios including error handling.
- The main orchestrating function `LoadAndProcessTopicIndex` in `pkg/indexerlogic/processing.go` serves as the primary entry point for this story's functionality, taking a configuration struct and returning the master list of topics or an error.
- The `go.mod` file was initialized and `go mod tidy` was run to ensure dependencies are consistent.

### Change Log
- 2025-05-26: Initial implementation of all tasks for Story 2.1 by Dev Agent.
- 2025-05-26: BMad IDE Orchestrator created initial draft.
