# Story 2.2: Implement Intra-Topic Page Navigation

## Status: Done

## Story

- As the Archival System,
- I want to, for each given Topic ID, reliably identify and navigate to all of its internal pages (e.g., page 1, 2, 3... up to the last page of that specific thread),
- So that I can systematically provide the URL for each individual page of a topic to the HTML download module.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*This story directly implements Functional Requirement 2.2 from the PRD. The ACs are derived from the PRD and typical requirements for robust page navigation.*

1.  **AC1:** Given a Topic ID (and ideally its base URL from the Topic Index from Story 2.1), the system MUST determine the URL for the first page of that topic.
2.  **AC2:** The system MUST be able to fetch and parse the content of a topic page to identify pagination controls or indicators (e.g., "Next Page" links, page number links, or total page count information).
3.  **AC3:** The system MUST correctly identify the URL for each subsequent page within the topic, sequentially.
4.  **AC4:** The system MUST accurately determine when it has reached the last page of a topic (e.g., no "Next Page" link, current page number matches total page count).
5.  **AC5:** The system MUST collect and return an ordered list of URLs, representing all pages of the given topic, from the first page to the last.
6.  **AC6:** The system MUST be resilient to common variations in forum pagination HTML structure (within reasonable limits of The Magic Cafe's typical design).
7.  **AC7:** The system MUST implement robust error handling for scenarios such as:
    *   Network errors when fetching a page to check for pagination.
    *   Inability to find or parse pagination information on a page.
    *   Unexpected HTML structure breaking pagination logic.
8.  **AC8:** If a topic is found to have only one page, the system MUST correctly return only the URL for that single page.
9.  **AC9:** The system SHOULD apply politeness delays (as configured in Story 2.5) when fetching topic pages for pagination analysis to avoid stressing the server, even if these are HEAD requests or lightweight GETs.
10. **AC10:** The system MUST log its activity, including the Topic ID being processed, the number of pages found, and any errors encountered during pagination discovery.
11. **AC11:** The output (list of page URLs) for a given Topic ID MUST be available in a format easily consumable by the HTML download module (Story 2.3).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Design Topic Page URL Construction (AC: 1, 3)
    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Define how to construct the URL for page 1 of a topic given its ID/base URL.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Research Magic Cafe URL structure for subsequent pages (e.g., `&page=2`).
- [ ] Task 2: Implement Page Fetching and Parsing for Pagination (AC: 2, 6, 7, 9)
    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Implement function to fetch a topic page (respecting politeness).
    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Implement HTML parsing logic (using `goquery` or similar) to find "Next Page" links, page number elements, or total page count indicators.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Implement error handling for fetch/parse failures.
- [ ] Task 3: Implement Pagination Logic (AC: 3, 4, 5, 8)
    - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Develop loop/recursion to navigate from one page to the next.
    - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Implement logic to detect the last page.
    - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Store collected page URLs in order.
    - [ ] Subtask 3.4: Handle single-page topics correctly.
- [ ] Task 4: Integration and Output (AC: 11)
    - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Define the output data structure for the list of page URLs.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Ensure the module can be easily called with a Topic ID (and its associated data from Story 2.1) and returns the list of page URLs.
- [ ] Task 5: Logging (AC: 10)
    - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Add logging for Topic ID processing, pages found, errors.
- [ ] Task 6: Unit Testing
    - [ ] Subtask 6.1: Write unit tests for URL construction.
    - [ ] Subtask 6.2: Write unit tests for page parsing logic (with mock HTML).
    - [ ] Subtask 6.3: Write unit tests for pagination logic (single page, multi-page, error cases).

## Dev Technical Guidance

- This module will likely be a Go package (e.g., `internal/archiver/navigation` or `pkg/navigation`).
- Input: A struct or data representing a single topic (from Story 2.1's output), including at least Topic ID and its base URL.
- Output: A slice of strings (URLs) or a slice of structs containing URL and page number.
- The HTML parsing should be targeted. It's not full content extraction, just enough to find pagination elements.
- Consider how The Magic Cafe indicates the total number of pages or the link to the "next" page. This might involve inspecting the HTML of actual topic pages.
- Example Topic URL: `https://www.themagiccafe.com/forums/viewtopic.php?topic_id={TOPIC_ID}`
- Example Paginated URL: `https://www.themagiccafe.com/forums/viewtopic.php?topic_id={TOPIC_ID}&page={PAGE_NUM}` (This needs verification)
