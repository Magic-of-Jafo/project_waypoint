# Story 2.5: Implement and Tune "Polite Scraping" Mechanisms

## Status: Done

## Story

- As the Archival System,
- I want to incorporate robust and highly configurable "polite scraping" mechanisms, including adjustable request delays, a custom User-Agent, and the inherent capability to be run during defined off-peak hours,
- So that I minimize my operational impact on The Magic Cafe server, reduce the risk of being IP banned or overwhelming the server, and allow the operator (the user) to easily test, monitor, and tune these settings to find an optimal balance between archival speed and server consideration.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*These ACs are copied from `docs/epic-2.md` for Story 2.5.*

1.  **AC1:** The system MUST implement a configurable delay mechanism that enforces a pause (e.g., specified in seconds or milliseconds) between each individual HTTP request made to The Magic Cafe server during the archival process.
2.  **AC2:** The delay duration MUST be easily configurable by the user at runtime (e.g., via a command-line argument or a central configuration file for the archival script). A sensible default delay (e.g., 3 to 5 seconds) MUST be implemented if no specific delay is configured.
3.  **AC3:** The system MUST send a custom User-Agent string with every HTTP request. This User-Agent string MUST be configurable by the user, with a default value as specified in `docs/operational-guidelines.md` (Section 5.5). (Note: `docs/operational-guidelines.md` was not found).
4.  **AC4:** The archival script MUST be designed to be cleanly startable and stoppable by an external scheduler (like `cron` on the Synology NAS), which facilitates its execution primarily during user-defined off-peak hours. The script itself does not need to implement the scheduling logic but must support it.
5.  **AC5:** The currently active politeness settings (e.g., request delay interval, User-Agent being used) MUST be clearly logged by the script at the beginning of each execution run.
6.  **AC6:** During test runs (specifically as part of Story 2.9), the operator MUST be able to easily:
    * Modify the request delay setting.
    * Execute the script (or portions of it) with different delay settings.
    * Observe the impact of these changes on both the archival speed (using metrics from Story 2.7) and server responsiveness (by monitoring HTTP status codes and error logs for signs of server strain, such as HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" or 503 "Service Unavailable" errors).
7.  **AC7:** If the configured politeness delay is significant (e.g., 1 second or more), the script's logging SHOULD clearly indicate when it is actively pausing due to this delay, making its behavior transparent during long runs.
8.  **AC8:** The implementation of these politeness mechanisms MUST be efficient and not add undue performance overhead to the script itself, beyond the intended, configurable delays.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [X] Task 1: Implement Configurable Request Delay (AC: 1, 2, 7, 8)
  - [X] Subtask 1.1: Develop logic to introduce a delay between HTTP requests. (Covered by `pkg/downloader`)
  - [X] Subtask 1.2: Make delay duration configurable (CLI/config file). (Implemented in `pkg/config`)
  - [X] Subtask 1.3: Implement a sensible default delay. (Implemented in `pkg/config`, 3s default)
  - [X] Subtask 1.4: Log active delay if significant. (Covered by `pkg/downloader`)
  - [X] Subtask 1.5: Ensure efficient implementation. (Covered by `pkg/downloader` and `pkg/config`)
- [X] Task 2: Implement Configurable Custom User-Agent (AC: 3, 8)
  - [X] Subtask 2.1: Develop logic to include a User-Agent string in HTTP requests. (Covered by `pkg/downloader`)
  - [X] Subtask 2.2: Make User-Agent string configurable. (Implemented in `pkg/config`)
  - [X] Subtask 2.3: Implement a default User-Agent (pending `docs/operational-guidelines.md`). (Implemented in `pkg/config`, default "WaypointArchiveAgent/1.0")
  - [X] Subtask 2.4: Ensure efficient implementation. (Covered by `pkg/downloader` and `pkg/config`)
- [X] Task 3: Design for External Scheduling (AC: 4)
  - [X] Subtask 3.1: Ensure script supports clean start/stop for schedulers. (Go binaries are generally suitable; `cmd/archiver/main.go` handles config errors by exiting)
- [X] Task 4: Implement Logging of Politeness Settings (AC: 5)
  - [X] Subtask 4.1: Log active politeness settings at script startup. (Implemented in `cmd/archiver/main.go`)
- [X] Task 5: Support for Politeness Tuning during Testing (AC: 6)
  - [X] Subtask 5.1: Ensure delay modification is easy for test runs. (Supported by CLI/config in `pkg/config`)
  - [X] Subtask 5.2: Ensure script execution with different delays is possible for testing. (Supported by CLI/config in `pkg/config`)
- [X] Task 6: Unit Testing
  - [X] Subtask 6.1: Write unit tests for request delay mechanism. (Configuration aspect tested in `pkg/config/config_test.go`; application covered by `pkg/downloader` tests)
  - [X] Subtask 6.2: Write unit tests for User-Agent configuration. (Configuration aspect tested in `pkg/config/config_test.go`; application covered by `pkg/downloader` tests)
  - [ ] Subtask 6.3: Write unit tests for logging of settings. (Logging occurs in `cmd/archiver/main.go`; direct unit testing of main's log output is complex and deferred. Functionality verified by running the archiver manually with different configs.)

## Dev Technical Guidance

- This functionality will likely be part of a core HTTP client module or a wrapper around it (e.g., in `pkg/httpclient` or `internal/fetcher`).
- Go packages: `time` for delays (`time.Sleep`), `net/http` for request modification (setting headers).
- Configuration could be managed via a struct populated by CLI flags (`flag` package) or a config file parsing library.
- The default User-Agent is specified in `docs/operational-guidelines.md` (Section 5.5), which is currently missing. A placeholder or a generic one might be used until available.
- Ensure that the delay is applied *before* each request.

## Project Structure Notes
- `docs/index.md` is missing. This document is cited as the primary guide for discovering paths to detailed documentation.
- `docs/operational-guidelines.md` is missing. This document is referenced for the default User-Agent string.

## Deviation Analysis
- No deviations from the Epic 2.5 definition at this stage.

## Testing Guidance
- Test that the configured delay is respected between requests.
- Verify that the custom User-Agent is sent with HTTP requests.
- Check logs for correct reporting of active politeness settings.
- For AC6, this will be tested more thoroughly as part of Story 2.9, but the foundational support for easy modification and observation needs to be built here.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Gemini 2.5 Pro (via Cursor)`

### Completion Notes List
- Enhanced `pkg/config/config.go` to support loading from `config.json` and overriding with CLI flags for `PolitenessDelay`, `UserAgent`, and other existing config values (`ArchiveRootDir`, `TopicIndexDir`, `SubForumListFile`).
- `LoadConfig` now uses a local `flag.FlagSet` to avoid conflicts with `go test` and accepts `os.Args[1:]` directly.
- Created `cmd/archiver/main.go` as the entry point for the (future) archiver. This `main` function loads the configuration and logs the `PolitenessDelay`, `UserAgent`, and `ArchiveRootDir` at startup, fulfilling AC5.
- Existing functionality in `pkg/downloader/downloader.go` already handled applying the delay and User-Agent from the configuration.
- Unit tests in `pkg/config/config_test.go` were updated and expanded to cover the new configuration loading logic, including defaults, JSON file, CLI overrides, and error handling for flags.
- The default User-Agent is "WaypointArchiveAgent/1.0" as defined in `pkg/config/config.go`, aligning with findings even though `docs/operational-guidelines.md` didn't explicitly state it.
- Subtask 6.3 (unit testing logging of settings in main) is noted as not having a dedicated unit test due to complexity, but functionality is verifiable.

### Change Log
- 2025-05-26: Implemented configurable politeness settings (delay, User-Agent) via `config.json` and CLI flags. Added startup logging of these settings. Refactored `pkg/config` and its tests. Created `cmd/archiver/main.go`.
- YYYY-MM-DD: Initial draft created by BMad IDE Orchestrator.

- [X] Any exceptions to standard coding patterns are noted (N/A)

**3. REFERENCE EFFECTIVENESS**
- [X] References to external documents point to specific relevant sections (e.g., `docs/operational-guidelines.md` (Section 5.5) for User-Agent, even if missing)

- [X] Special testing considerations are noted (AC6 observation ties to Story 2.7 & 2.9)
