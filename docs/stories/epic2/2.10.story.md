# Story 2.10: Execute Full Forum Raw HTML Archival

## Status: Draft

## Story

- **As an** Operator of the Archival System,
- **I want** to execute the fully tested, refined, and configured Core Archival Script (from Story 2.8, validated in Story 2.9) to systematically process all Topic IDs from the master index, downloading and saving the complete raw HTML for every page of every identified topic from The Magic Cafe forum,
- **So that** the "Waypoint Archive" on my Synology NAS contains a comprehensive and complete raw HTML backup of the entire forum, fulfilling the primary data preservation goal of this Epic.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  **AC1:** The Core Archival Script (as validated and refined through Story 2.9) is configured with the master Topic Index (generated in Epic 1) and set to process all Topic IDs that have not yet been successfully archived (or to process the entire list if running from scratch with resumability).
2.  **AC2:** The script is launched on the chosen execution platform (e.g., Synology NAS for a long, unattended run, or the laptop, based on the decision made after Story 2.9's performance analysis) to begin the full archival process.
3.  **AC3:** The script systematically works through the prioritized list of Topic IDs (as prepared by Story 2.1), performing the "Just-In-Time (JIT) Index Refresh" for each new sub-forum's topics before processing them (as per Story 2.8 AC9).
4.  **AC4:** For each topic, the script correctly navigates all its internal pages (as per Story 2.2), downloads the raw HTML for each page (as per Story 2.3), and saves the HTML files to the designated location (e.g., Synology NAS) in the correct directory structure (as per Story 2.4).
5.  **AC5:** The script consistently applies the tuned "polite scraping" mechanisms (delay, User-Agent, as per Story 2.5) throughout the entire execution duration.
6.  **AC6:** The script correctly utilizes its resumable state management (as per Story 2.6), allowing for the process to be stopped and restarted (manually, by schedule, or due to unforeseen interruptions) and to continue from where it left off.
7.  **AC7:** Performance metrics and Estimated Time to Completion (ETC) (as per Story 2.7) continue to be logged throughout the full run, providing ongoing visibility into the progress of this potentially lengthy operation.
8.  **AC8:** The script runs until all Topic IDs in the master list have been processed, or until it is determined that all accessible content based on the provided index has been archived.
9.  **AC9:** Comprehensive operational logs are maintained for the entire full archival run, detailing overall progress, batches processed, any errors encountered (and how they were handled, e.g., skipped items after retries), and final completion statistics.
10. **AC10:** Upon completion of this story, the "Waypoint Archive" on the Synology NAS is confirmed to contain the raw HTML files for all successfully processed topics and their pages from the master index.
11. **AC11:** A final summary report or log entry indicates the total number of topics and pages successfully archived in this full run, the total duration, average performance metrics, and a list of any Topic IDs/pages that could not be archived after all defined error handling and retry attempts.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [X] Task 1: **Pre-Execution Configuration & Setup (AC: 1, 2)**
  - [X] Subtask 1.1: Confirm the Core Archival Script (`run_archiver.go` from Story 2.8) is stable and all functionalities from Stories 2.1-2.7 are fully integrated and tested as per Story 2.9 completion.
  - [X] Subtask 1.2: Prepare/Verify the Master Topic Index file(s) (output of Epic 1) are available and correctly formatted for consumption by the script.
  - [X] Subtask 1.3: Determine and configure the target execution platform (Synology NAS or laptop).
  - [X] Subtask 1.4: Configure the `config.json` (or equivalent mechanism) for the full run:
    - Set `TestSubForumIDs` to an empty list or remove it to process all sub-forums.
    - Ensure `ArchiveOutputRootDir` points to the final production archive location on the Synology NAS.
    - Set `TopicIndexDir` to the location of the complete, master topic indices.
    - Set `SubForumListFile` to the production list of all sub-forums to be archived.
    - Configure `StateFilePath` to a persistent location for the full run's progress.
    - Configure `LogFilePath` and `PerformanceLogPath` for the full run.
    - Set `PolitenessDelay` to the tuned value determined in Story 2.9 (e.g., 2-5 seconds).
    - Set `UserAgent` to the production value (e.g., "WaypointArchiveAgent/1.0 (ProductionRun contact@example.com)").
    - Review and confirm `SaveStateInterval`, `JITRefreshPages`, `JITRefreshInterval`, `ForumBaseURL`, and `TopicIndexFilePattern`.
    - Set `LogLevel` to `INFO` or `DEBUG` as appropriate for monitoring the long run.
  - [X] Subtask 1.5: Ensure sufficient disk space is available on the Synology NAS for the anticipated full archive size.
  - [X] Subtask 1.6: Review `docs/operational-guidelines.md` for any final pre-run checks.

- [ ] Task 2: **Execute the Full Archival Run (AC: 2-8)**
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Launch the `run_archiver.go` script on the chosen platform with the production configuration.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Monitor initial script startup, ensuring it loads the Topic Index and resumes from a previous state if applicable.
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Periodically monitor logs for:
    - Progress (sub-forums/topics being processed). (AC: 3, 4)
    - JIT Index Refresh operations. (AC: 3)
    - Correct application of politeness delays. (AC: 5)
    - State saving confirmations. (AC: 6)
    - Performance metrics and ETC updates. (AC: 7)
    - Any recurring errors or unexpected behavior.
  - [x] Subtask 2.4: (If applicable) Test stop and restart functionality at an opportune moment to verify resumability under production load. (AC: 6)

- [ ] Task 3: **Post-Execution Verification & Reporting (AC: 9, 10, 11)**
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Once the script reports completion (or is stopped after processing all known items), perform a thorough review of the operational logs. (AC: 9)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Verify the "Waypoint Archive" on the Synology NAS:
    - Check directory structure.
    - Spot-check a sample of archived HTML files for completeness and integrity.
    - Compare the number of archived items/directories with expected counts from the Topic Index. (AC: 10)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Generate/Extract a final summary report including: (AC: 11)
    - Total topics and pages successfully archived.
    - Total execution duration.
    - Overall average performance metrics (pages/min, topics/hour, MB/min).
    - List of any Topic IDs/pages that could not be archived (with reasons, if available from logs).
  - [ ] Subtask 3.4: Backup the final state file and logs.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- This story is primarily about executing and monitoring the `run_archiver.go` script, which should be feature-complete from previous stories.
- **Key Configuration File:** `config.json` (or its equivalent, as defined in Story 2.8 AC10) will be central to this story. Ensure all parameters are set correctly for a full production run.
- **Monitoring:** Long-running processes require diligent monitoring. Use `tail -f` on log files, check resource utilization on the execution platform, and be prepared for potential (though hopefully minimal) manual intervention if unexpected persistent errors occur.
- **Resumability is Key:** Given the potential length of a full forum archive, the ability to stop and resume is critical. This might be tested early in the full run.
- **Data Verification:** While full verification of every single file is impractical, a sampling strategy should be employed to build confidence in the archive's integrity.
- Refer to Story 2.9's test results and recommendations for initial `PolitenessDelay` and other operational parameters.
- Ensure the `User-Agent` for the production run is distinct and provides a way to contact the operator if necessary (e.g., including an email).
