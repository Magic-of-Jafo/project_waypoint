# Story 2.3: Implement Raw HTML Page Download Functionality

## Status: Done

## Story

- As the Archival System,
- I want to take any specific Magic Cafe topic page URL (provided by the Intra-Topic Page Navigation logic from Story 2.2) and reliably download its complete, unaltered, raw HTML content,
- So that this raw HTML can be passed to the file storage module (Story 2.4) for preservation in the "Waypoint Archive."

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*These ACs are copied from `docs/epic-2.md` for Story 2.3.*

1.  **AC1:** Given a valid URL for an individual page within a Magic Cafe topic, the system MUST be able to successfully execute an HTTP GET request to that URL.
2.  **AC2:** The system MUST retrieve the full HTTP response from the server for the given URL.
3.  **AC3:** The system MUST extract the complete, raw HTML content (as a byte stream or accurately decoded string, ensuring original encoding is preserved or handled correctly, typically UTF-8 for modern web content but should be verified from response headers) from the body of the HTTP response.
4.  **AC4:** The downloaded HTML content MUST be preserved exactly as received from the server. No parsing (beyond what's necessary to get the raw content from the response object), modification, or stripping of tags should occur during this download process itself (full parsing happens in Epic 3).
5.  **AC5:** The system MUST correctly handle character encodings as specified in the HTTP response headers. If no encoding is specified, it should default to a sensible standard (e.g., UTF-8) and ensure the raw byte stream is captured faithfully if precise decoding is uncertain, to prevent data loss.
6.  **AC6:** The system MUST implement robust error handling for network-related issues that may occur during the download attempt (e.g., connection timeouts, DNS resolution failures, SSL handshake issues), adhering to the protocols defined in `docs/operational-guidelines.md` (Section 4: Error Handling and Logging Protocols). This includes logging the error and the problematic URL.
7.  **AC7:** The system MUST handle HTTP error status codes returned by the server (e.g., 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 5xx Server Errors) by:
    * Logging the problematic URL and the received HTTP status code.
    * Following the defined retry strategy (if applicable for the error type, as per Story 2.5 and `docs/operational-guidelines.md`) or gracefully skipping the page and marking it as problematic for this run.
8.  **AC8:** The "polite scraping" mechanisms (such as configured delays *before* making the request and sending the custom User-Agent string, as defined in Story 2.5) MUST be respected by this download functionality.
    *   ***Note for Scrum Master/Dev for Story 2.3:*** *Ensure that the `PolitenessDelay` configured in `pkg/config/config.go` (and intended to be populated from CLI flags/Story 2.5) is correctly passed to and utilized by the HTML fetching mechanism used in this story.* 
9.  **AC9:** The successfully downloaded raw HTML content for a page MUST be made available as output (e.g., as a string or byte slice/array in Go) to be consumed by the next module responsible for file storage (Story 2.4).

    - [X] Subtask 6.4: Write unit tests for HTTP error code handling (simulating 403, 404, 500 responses).

## Dev Technical Guidance

- This module will be a Go package/function, likely part of the `internal/archiver` or `pkg/downloader`.
- Primary Go package: `net/http` for making HTTP GET requests.
- Input: A string representing the URL of the Magic Cafe topic page.
- Output: Raw HTML content (e.g., `[]byte` which is generally safer for raw data, or a `string` if encoding is confidently handled) and an error type.
- Character encoding: Pay close attention to `Content-Type` header from the server. `golang.org/x/net/html/charset` can help with robust encoding detection if needed, but prioritize capturing raw bytes if decoding is ambiguous.
- This module is a core component and needs to be robust. It will be called repeatedly by the logic in Story 2.2 (which provides URLs) and its output will be passed to Story 2.4 (for file saving).
- It must interact with the politeness configurations from Story 2.5 (delays, User-Agent). The `PolitenessDelay` value and User-Agent string should be passed into this module or accessed from a shared configuration.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Gemini 2.5 Pro (via Cursor)`

### Completion Notes List
- Implemented a new Go package `pkg/downloader` for HTML fetching.
- The `Downloader` struct encapsulates an HTTP client, User-Agent, and PolitenessDelay, initialized via `NewDownloader(cfg *config.Config)`.
- The primary function `FetchPage(url string) ([]byte, error)` handles the download process.
- Character encoding is handled using `golang.org/x/net/html/charset`. If encoding is uncertain and not UTF-8, raw bytes are read to prevent data loss (AC5).
- Error handling for network issues and HTTP status codes (4xx, 5xx) is implemented. HTTP errors are returned as a custom `HTTPError` type. Problematic URLs are logged (AC6, AC7).
- Politeness mechanisms (delay and User-Agent from `config.Config`) are integrated (AC8). `PolitenessDelay` is configurable and applied before each request. The User-Agent is passed in request headers.
- The function returns raw HTML as `[]byte` (AC9).
- Retry logic (mentioned in AC7 and Story 2.5) is explicitly NOT handled within this module; it is expected to be managed by the calling orchestrator or a higher-level retry mechanism, as per Story 2.5 requirements.
- Comprehensive unit tests (`pkg/downloader/downloader_test.go`) cover successful downloads, various encoding scenarios, network errors, HTTP errors, and politeness mechanism integration.
- `pkg/config/config.go` was updated to include `UserAgent` and `PolitenessDelay` fields, along with default values. The `LoadConfig` function will need to be enhanced in Story 2.5 to support CLI flags for these.

### Change Log
- {YYYY-MM-DD}: Initial draft created by BMad IDE Orchestrator.
- 2025-05-26: Implemented `pkg/downloader` with `FetchPage` function and associated unit tests. Updated `pkg/config/config.go` to include `UserAgent` and `PolitenessDelay`. Marked story as Completed. (Implemented by Dev persona with Gemini 2.5 Pro via Cursor)
