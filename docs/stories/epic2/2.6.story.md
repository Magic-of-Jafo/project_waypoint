# Story 2.6: Implement Resumable State Management for Archival

## Status: Done

## Story

- As the Archival System,
- I want to maintain a persistent record of my progress through the master list of Topic IDs (and the pages within each topic) that are being archived, updating this record frequently and reliably,
- So that if the archival process is stopped or interrupted for any reason (e.g., manual stop, script error, system shutdown, end of a scheduled execution window), it can be restarted and will automatically and accurately resume from the exact point it left off, preventing the re-downloading of already archived pages and ensuring no content is inadvertently skipped.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*These ACs are copied from `docs/epic-2.md` for Story 2.6.*

1.  **AC1:** The system MUST maintain a persistent state that accurately records, at a minimum, the last successfully and completely archived Topic ID and, if a topic was only partially completed during the interruption, the last successfully archived page number *within* that topic.
2.  **AC2:** This progress state MUST be saved to a designated local file (e.g., `archive_progress.json`, `last_processed_state.txt`) in a user-configurable location (e.g., on the Synology NAS alongside the archive or logs).
3.  **AC3:** The progress state file MUST be updated at regular, defined intervals during the archival process (e.g., after each topic is fully archived, or after every N successfully archived pages, with N being configurable but defaulting to a reasonably small number to minimize reprocessing on resume).
4.  **AC4:** Upon starting an archival run, the system MUST automatically check for the existence of this progress state file.
5.  **AC5:** If a progress state file exists and indicates a previously interrupted run, the system MUST automatically resume the archival process from the next logical item based on the saved state:
    * If a topic was partially completed, it resumes with the next unarchived page of that topic.
    * If a topic was fully completed, it resumes with the next Topic ID in the prioritized list (as determined by Story 2.1).
6.  **AC6:** When resuming, the system MUST correctly use the master Topic Index (as loaded and ordered by Story 2.1) to identify and skip all Topic IDs and pages within those topics that were successfully archived before the interruption, based on the progress state file.
7.  **AC7:** The state management logic MUST correctly interact with the prioritized processing order of sub-forums and topics (as defined in Story 2.1) to ensure resumption occurs at the correct point in the overall sequence.
8.  **AC8:** The resumability feature MUST function correctly and be essential for scripts designed to run in scheduled batches (e.g., for off-peak operation), allowing each new batch to seamlessly continue from where the previous batch concluded.
9.  **AC9:** The format of the progress state file MUST be robust, easily parsable by the script, and employ safe-writing techniques (e.g., write to a temporary file then rename, or use journaling) to minimize the risk of corruption if an interruption occurs *during* a state save.
10. **AC10:** In the event of an unexpected crash or ungraceful shutdown, the last successfully saved state should allow the script to resume with minimal reprocessing (i.e., at most, only re-archiving the items processed since the very last successful state save).
11. **AC11:** The system SHOULD log when it is resuming from a previous state and the point from which it is resuming.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **File Format:** JSON is recommended for the state file (`archive_progress.json`) due to its human-readability and easy parsing in Go (`encoding/json` package).
- **State Structure Example (JSON):**
  ```json
  {
    "last_processed_sub_forum_id": "string_id_or_name", // For context with Story 2.1 ordering
    "last_processed_topic_id": "int_or_string_topic_id",
    "last_processed_page_number_in_topic": "int_page_number", // 0 if topic fully completed, or last page if partially done
    "processed_topic_ids_in_current_sub_forum": ["id1", "id2"], // Helps resume within a sub-forum
    "completed_sub_forum_ids": ["id_A", "id_B"] // Helps skip entire sub-forums quickly
  }
  ```
  Consider what level of detail is optimal for efficient resumption vs. complexity. The ACs only strictly require Topic ID and page number. The above is a more robust suggestion.
- **Configuration:** The path to the state file should be added to `pkg/config/config.go` and be configurable like other paths (e.g., `StateFilePath` in `Config` struct, settable via JSON config or CLI flag).
- **Safe Writing:** To implement safe writes:
  1. Write the new state to a temporary file (e.g., `archive_progress.json.tmp`).
  2. If successful, rename the temporary file to the actual state file (`archive_progress.json`), overwriting the old one. This is often an atomic operation on many filesystems.
  Use `os.WriteFile` (or `ioutil.WriteFile` for older Go) and `os.Rename`.
- **Integration:**
  - The main archiver loop will need to consult the loaded state before processing any topic/page.
  - The `config` package will need a new field for the state file path.
- Dependencies: This story relies heavily on the output of Story 2.1 (prioritized Topic Index) for correct resumption sequencing.

## Project Structure Notes
- Create a new package, e.g., `pkg/state`, for state management logic (loading, saving, structure definition).
- Modify `pkg/config/config.go` to add `StateFilePath`.
- Modify `cmd/archiver/main.go` (or equivalent main control flow) to initialize, load, and periodically save state.

## Deviation Analysis
- No deviations anticipated.

## Testing Guidance
- Test scenarios:
  - Archiver starts with no state file (fresh run).
  - Archiver stops mid-topic; restarts and resumes from the correct page.
  - Archiver stops after completing a topic; restarts and resumes from the next topic.
  - Archiver stops after completing a sub-forum; restarts and resumes from the next sub-forum.
  - State file is corrupted or unparsable (should ideally start fresh or error gracefully).
  - Test interaction with the JIT Index Refresh (Story 2.8 AC9) â€“ ensuring newly added topics via JIT are not skipped if an interruption happened before they were processed.
- Use mock objects or interfaces for dependencies like the Topic Index provider to isolate state management logic during unit tests.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Gemini 2.5 Pro (via Cursor)`

### Completion Notes List
- Created `pkg/state` for state management.
- Defined `ArchiveProgressState` in `pkg/state/types.go`.
- Implemented `SaveState` (with safe-write) and `LoadState` in `pkg/state/persistence.go`.
- Added `StateFilePath` to `pkg/config/config.go` and its tests.
- Integrated `LoadState` into `cmd/archiver/main.go` startup, with logging for new/resumed state.
- Added unit tests for `SaveState` and `LoadState` in `pkg/state/persistence_test.go`, covering various scenarios including safe-writes and file not found.
- Remaining subtasks (periodic saving, full resume logic in main loop, and related tests) are deferred until the main archival processing loop is implemented in a subsequent story.

### Change Log
- 2025-05-26: Implemented foundational state persistence (definition, save, load). Added to config and archiver startup. Unit tests for persistence functions created.
- YYYY-MM-DD: Initial draft created by BMad IDE Orchestrator.
