# Story 1.6: Integrate and Configure Core Indexing Script

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a Developer/Operator of the Indexing System,
- I want to integrate all the developed indexing modules—including sub-forum page navigation, topic ID (and ancillary data) extraction, the two-pass indexing strategy, persistent Topic Index storage, and performance metrics/ETC calculation—into a single, configurable, and executable core indexing script,
- So that I can reliably and efficiently initiate and manage the complete indexing process for any target Magic Cafe sub-forum from my laptop, producing the required persistent Topic Index.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  A primary executable script (e.g., a main Go script, based on `docs/tech-stack.md`) is created that orchestrates the end-to-end indexing process for a specified Magic Cafe sub-forum.
2.  The script successfully incorporates and utilizes the sub-forum page navigation logic (developed in Story 1.1) to iterate through all thread listing pages of a target sub-forum.
3.  The script successfully incorporates and utilizes the topic ID and ancillary data (e.g., title, readily available URL) extraction logic (developed in Story 1.2) for each topic found on those pages.
4.  The script correctly implements and executes the two-pass indexing strategy (initial full scan followed by a first-page re-scan) for the target sub-forum, as defined in Story 1.3.
5.  The script correctly utilizes the persistent Topic Index storage mechanisms (developed in Story 1.4 - specifically the functionality for saving Topic Index files to the configured path) to save the final, de-duplicated list of unique Topic IDs (and any associated data) for the processed sub-forum.
6.  The script accurately implements, tracks, and displays/logs the performance metrics and Estimated Time to Completion (ETC) calculations as defined in Story 1.5.
7.  The core indexing script MUST be configurable, allowing the user to specify (e.g., via command-line arguments or a simple configuration file):
    *   The target sub-forum ID (or its base URL).
    *   The base output directory for all generated files (aligning with Story 1.4's configurable base storage path). Topic Index files will be saved relative to this.
    *   Key "polite scraping" parameters (e.g., the delay between HTTP requests).
    *   Logging verbosity level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, ERROR).
8.  The script MUST produce comprehensive operational logs detailing its progress, key actions, performance metrics, ETCs, and any errors encountered, consistent with the logging requirements from previous stories.
9.  The script MUST be runnable and perform as expected within the user's laptop environment (assuming all necessary dependencies, like Go and required libraries, are correctly installed).
10. Upon successful completion of an indexing run for a sub-forum, the script generates the expected persistent Topic Index file(s) in the specified location (within the configured base output directory), containing the accurate and de-duplicated set of Topic IDs for that sub-forum.

    - [X] Subtask 3.3: Integrate Story 1.3 module (Two-Pass Strategy).
    - [X] Subtask 3.4: Integrate Story 1.4 module (Persistent Topic Index Storage - file writing part).
    - [X] Subtask 3.5: Integrate Story 1.5 module (Performance Metrics & ETC).
    - [X] Subtask 3.6: Ensure smooth data flow and error propagation between modules.
- [X] Task 4 (AC: 8): Consolidate and enhance logging.
    - [X] Subtask 4.1: Ensure all modules contribute to a unified logging output.
    - [X] Subtask 4.2: Implement configurable logging levels.
- [X] Task 5 (AC: 9, 10): Finalize script for execution and output verification.
    - [X] Subtask 5.1: Perform end-to-end tests with sample data.
    - [X] Subtask 5.2: Verify correct generation of Topic Index files in the specified output directory.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- This story is the culmination of Epic 1's core development, bringing all pieces together.
- Adhere to Go best practices for application structure (e.g., `cmd/appname/main.go`, internal packages for modules from previous stories).
- Configuration management is key. Using a library like `spf13/viper` for config files and `spf13/cobra` for CLI arguments can be beneficial for more complex configurations, or standard library `flag` for simpler ones.
- Ensure robust error handling throughout the integrated script. Errors from one module should be handled gracefully or propagated appropriately.
- The script should have a clear main loop or orchestrator function that calls the different stages of indexing (navigation, extraction, two-pass logic, storage, metrics).
- Pay close attention to the dependencies between stories and ensure the interfaces between modules are clean.

## Project Structure Notes

- The main executable (e.g., `cmd/indexer/main.go`) will be the primary output of this story.
- Modules developed in Stories 1.1-1.5 will be organized as internal packages (e.g., `internal/indexer/navigation`, `internal/indexer/extraction`, `internal/indexer/storage`, `internal/indexer/metrics`).
- Configuration files (if used) should be documented and potentially version-controlled if they contain default settings.

## Deviation Analysis

- AC7 in PRD for Story 1.6 mentions "output directory for the persistent Topic Index file(s)". This should align with the configurable base path from Story 1.4, ensuring consistency. The story above clarifies this.

## Testing Guidance

- **Approach:** Primarily integration testing, focusing on the end-to-end workflow. Unit tests for individual modules should have been covered in their respective stories.
- **Test Scenarios:**
    - Indexing a small sub-forum from start to finish with all features active.
    - Verifying correct output of Topic Index files in the configured directory.
    - Testing all configuration options (target sub-forum, output dir, politeness delay, log level).
    - Observing correct logging output, including performance metrics and ETC.
    - Testing error handling for issues originating in any of the integrated modules (e.g., page fetch error, parsing error).
    - Confirming script runs correctly on the target laptop environment.
- **Success Criteria:** All Acceptance Criteria (1-10) must be met.
- **Test Data:** Requires a live or simulated small sub-forum environment, or comprehensive mock data that can simulate the outputs of each module accurately.
