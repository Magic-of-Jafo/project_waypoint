# Story 1.7: Conduct Test Run & Refine Indexing System on a Small Sub-Forum

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a Developer/Operator of the Indexing System,
- I want to execute the fully integrated Core Indexing Script (developed in Story 1.6) on a designated small, manageable sub-forum (e.g., the one with ~2000 topics, `viewforum.php?forum=54`) and meticulously analyze its performance, the accuracy of its output, and the utility of its logging and metrics,
- So that I can validate the entire indexing system's functionality in a real-world scenario, gather initial performance benchmarks, and identify any necessary refinements or bugs before attempting larger-scale or full-forum indexing tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  A specific, relatively small Magic Cafe sub-forum (e.g., `forum=54`) is formally selected for the initial test run.
2.  The Core Indexing Script (from Story 1.6) is configured with the target test sub-forum, appropriate politeness settings (e.g., initial delay of 3-5 seconds), and output locations for logs and the Topic Index file (aligning with Story 1.4's configurable base path).
3.  The script is executed on the user's laptop and runs the complete two-pass indexing process for the test sub-forum from start to finish.
4.  The script completes the test run without unhandled exceptions or critical errors that prematurely halt the entire process. (Gracefully handled errors, if any, should be logged).
5.  A persistent Topic Index file for the test sub-forum is successfully generated in the specified output location.
6.  The content of the generated Topic Index file is reviewed:
    *   The number of unique Topic IDs collected is manually compared against an estimate for the test sub-forum to ensure reasonable completeness.
    *   A spot-check of a few Topic IDs and any associated data (like titles, if captured) is performed to verify accuracy.
7.  The performance metrics (e.g., processing rate, total time taken) and the dynamically calculated Estimated Time to Completion (ETC) logged by the script during the test run are reviewed for plausibility and consistency.
8.  The operational logs generated during the test run are reviewed for clarity, informativeness, and to identify any unexpected warnings or non-critical errors.
9.  Based on the outcomes of the test run (AC3-AC8), initial real-world performance benchmarks (e.g., average pages/topics indexed per minute with the chosen politeness delay for *this specific forum's structure*) are documented.
10. Any bugs, significant performance bottlenecks, inaccuracies in data extraction, or deficiencies in logging/metrics identified during the test run are documented, and a plan for their refinement (either immediate or before scaling up) is noted.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [X] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2): Test Setup & Configuration.
    - [X] Subtask 1.1: Formally select and document the small target sub-forum (e.g., `forum=54`).
        - Selected sub-forum: `forum=48` (User suggested, ~16 pages. Original example was `forum=54`).
    - [X] Subtask 1.2: Configure the Core Indexing Script (Story 1.6) for the test run: target sub-forum, politeness delay (e.g., 3-5s), base output directory, log level.
        - Target sub-forum URL: `https://www.themagiccafe.com/forums/viewforum.php?forum=48`
        - Politeness delay: `3000` milliseconds (3 seconds)
        - Base output directory: `tests/run-001-forum-48/`
        - Log level: `INFO`
        - Max pages: `0` (no limit)
        - Command: `go run cmd/indexer/main.go -url="https://www.themagiccafe.com/forums/viewforum.php?forum=48" -output="tests/run-001-forum-48/" -delay=3000 -loglevel="INFO" -maxpages=0`
    - [X] Subtask 1.3: Ensure necessary environment/dependencies for the script are in place on the laptop.
        - Go is installed and `go.mod` is initialized.
        - `github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery` dependency was added previously.
        - Ran `go mod tidy` to confirm dependencies are clean.
- [X] Task 2 (AC: 3, 4): Execute Test Run.
    - [X] Subtask 2.1: Initiate and monitor the Core Indexing Script for the test sub-forum.
        - Successfully ran for `forum=48`.
    - [X] Subtask 2.2: Document the script's execution from start to finish, noting any manual interventions or observations.
        - Script completed successfully for `forum=48` without manual intervention. Detailed execution captured in log file.
    - [X] Subtask 2.3: Collect all logs generated during the test run.
        - Log file: `tests/run-001-forum-48/indexer_run_forum48.log`.
- [X] Task 3 (AC: 5, 6): Output Verification & Accuracy Check.
    - [X] Subtask 3.1: Verify the creation and correct location of the Topic Index file for the test sub-forum.
        - File `tests/run-001-forum-48/topic_index_48.json` created successfully in the correct location.
    - [X] Subtask 3.2: Manually (or with a helper script) estimate the expected number of unique topics for the test sub-forum and compare with the script's output.
        - Script log (`indexer_run_forum48.log`) reports 397 unique Topic IDs collected and saved.
        - Script discovered 14 pages for `forum=48`. User confirmed this is correct, initial estimate of 16 was off.
    - [X] Subtask 3.3: Perform spot-checks on a sample of Topic IDs from the output file: verify titles (if captured) and general URL structure against the live forum.
        - User confirmed spot-checks are satisfactory.
- [X] Task 4 (AC: 7, 8): Performance & Log Analysis.
    - [X] Subtask 4.1: Analyze logged performance metrics (total time, processing rates).
        - Total run time for forum=48 (14 pages, 397 topics, 3s delay): 46 seconds.
        - Effective page processing rate (full scan): ~21 pages/minute.
        - Effective topic discovery rate (overall): ~518 topics/minute.
        - Performance is dominated by the politeness delay, as expected.
    - [X] Subtask 4.2: Review the behavior and accuracy of the ETC calculations during the run.
        - ETC reporting is functional and appears plausible.
        - Accuracy improves as more pages are processed; initial estimate was high but converged quickly.
    - [X] Subtask 4.3: Scrutinize operational logs for clarity, detail, and any unexpected errors/warnings.
        - Logs are clear at INFO level, detailing major steps and counts.
        - No warnings or errors encountered during the run.
        - Suggestion: Ensure final summary metrics (total time, overall rates) are explicitly logged by the deferred `FinalizeAndLogMetrics` function (to be verified in future runs or by code inspection if necessary).
- [X] Task 5 (AC: 9, 10): Documentation & Refinement Planning.
    - [X] Subtask 5.1: Document the initial performance benchmarks observed (e.g., pages/min, topics/min for `forum=48` with X delay).
        - Test Run: `forum=48` (14 pages, 397 topics)
        - Politeness Delay: 3 seconds (3000ms)
        - Total Run Time: 46 seconds
        - Page Processing Rate (full scan portion): ~21 pages/minute
        - Topic Discovery Rate (overall): ~518 topics/minute
    - [X] Subtask 5.2: Compile a detailed list of any bugs, bottlenecks, data inaccuracies, or logging/metric deficiencies found.
        - **Bugs:** None found in this test run.
        - **Bottlenecks:** Intended politeness delay is the main factor; actual processing is fast.
        - **Data Inaccuracies:** None found; page and topic counts were verified as accurate for forum=48.
        - **Logging/Metric Deficiencies:**
            - Log file name in `cmd/indexer/main.go` is hardcoded. Needs to be dynamic or configurable.
            - The final summary from `tracker.FinalizeAndLogMetrics()` (e.g., total time, overall rates) was not visible in the provided log snippet and should be explicitly confirmed or enhanced if missing detailed summary lines at the very end.
    - [X] Subtask 5.3: Develop a concrete plan or list of action items for refining the Core Indexing Script based on findings.
        1.  **Refinement: Dynamic Log File Naming in `cmd/indexer/main.go`**
            - **Action:** Modify `cmd/indexer/main.go`.
            - **Detail:** Implement dynamic log file naming (e.g., `indexer_run_forum<ID>_<TIMESTAMP>.log`) within the `cfg.outputDir`, or add a `-logfile` flag.
        2.  **Refinement: Verify/Enhance Final Metrics Logging in `internal/indexer/metrics/metrics.go` and `cmd/indexer/main.go`**
            - **Action:** Inspect/Modify `metrics.FinalizeAndLogMetrics()` and its usage.
            - **Detail:** Ensure a comprehensive summary (total time, requests, pages, topics, rates, re-scan impact) is logged at script termination.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- This story is less about new code development and more about rigorous testing, observation, and analysis of the integrated system (from Story 1.6).
- Methodology: Treat this as a formal test pass. Document setup, execution steps, expected results, actual results, and deviations.
- The chosen test sub-forum should be small enough for a manageable test run but large enough to provide meaningful performance data and test various scenarios (e.g., multiple pages of topics).
- Be meticulous in reviewing logs and output data. Small discrepancies can indicate larger underlying issues.
- The "plan for refinement" (AC10) should be specific enough to translate into actionable development tasks if needed in subsequent sprints or iterations.

## Project Structure Notes

- Create a dedicated directory for this test run, e.g., `tests/run-001-forum-54/`.
- Store all configuration files used, logs generated, output Topic Index files, and analysis notes/reports within this directory.
- The refinement plan (AC10) can be a separate document or section within a test report.

## Deviation Analysis

- No deviations from PRD anticipated for this story itself, as it's primarily a testing and analysis task based on prior work.

## Testing Guidance

- **Approach:** This entire story *is* a test. It's an end-to-end system validation on a controlled, small-scale live target.
- **Test Scenarios:** The Acceptance Criteria themselves define the core test scenario and checks to be performed.
- **Success Criteria:** Successful completion of all ACs, resulting in documented benchmarks and a clear list of any required refinements.
- **Test Data:** The live data from the selected small Magic Cafe sub-forum (e.g., `forum=54`).
