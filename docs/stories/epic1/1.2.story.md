# Story 1.2: Develop Topic ID & URL Extraction Logic

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a Developer of the Indexing System,
- I want to create a module that can accurately parse the HTML content of a single Magic Cafe sub-forum page (a page listing multiple topics) to identify and extract the title, unique Topic ID, and direct URL for each individual topic listed on that page,
- So that a comprehensive list of all topics to be archived can be systematically compiled.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  Given the raw HTML content of a single thread listing page from a Magic Cafe sub-forum (e.g., a `viewforum.php?forum=X&start=Y` page), the system can successfully identify all distinct HTML elements that represent individual topics (threads).
2.  For each identified topic element, the system can accurately extract the full topic title as displayed on the page.
3.  For each identified topic element, the system can accurately extract its unique Topic ID (this is often part of the topic's URL, e.g., the `topic=N` parameter).
4.  For each identified topic element, the system can accurately extract the direct URL that links to that specific topic (e.g., a `viewtopic.php?topic=N...`) if readily available and distinct from a constructible URL based on Topic ID alone.
5.  The system correctly associates the extracted title and Topic ID (and readily available URL, if applicable) for each topic.
6.  The system can process pages containing a variable number of topics, including the last page of a sub-forum which may not be full.
7.  The system correctly distinguishes and extracts data for regular topics, "sticky" topics, and any "announcement" topics if they have a similar linkable structure leading to thread content.
8.  The system logs an informative message or error if it encounters an HTML structure for a topic element that it cannot parse as expected, and ideally, skips that problematic element while continuing with others if possible.
9.  The list of extracted topic data (primarily Topic IDs, plus titles/URLs if captured) from a single processed page does not contain duplicates originating from that same page.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1): Design HTML parsing strategy for topic elements.
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Identify common HTML structures/attributes for topic containers.
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Evaluate `golang.org/x/net/html` and `PuerkitoBio/goquery` for suitability.
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 2, 3, 4, 5): Implement extraction logic for topic data.
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Function to extract topic title.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Function to extract Topic ID (typically from URL).
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Function to extract direct topic URL.
  - [x] Subtask 2.4: Function to associate extracted data per topic.
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 6, 7): Handle variations in page content and topic types.
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Ensure logic works for pages with few topics (e.g., last page).
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Implement differentiation for sticky/announcement topics if their structure impacts link/ID extraction. (Covered by general parsing logic)
- [x] Task 4 (AC: 8): Implement error handling for parsing.
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Log errors for unparsable topic elements.
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Implement logic to skip problematic elements and continue.
- [x] Task 5 (AC: 9): Ensure de-duplication of results from a single page.
  - [x] Subtask 5.1: Implement a mechanism to track and prevent duplicate topic data from the same page processing.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- Primary technology: Go.
- HTML Parsing:
    - Recommended libraries: `PuerkitoBio/goquery` (for CSS selector-based parsing) or `golang.org/x/net/html` (for direct DOM traversal). Refer to `docs/tech-stack.md`.
- The parsing logic must be robust enough to identify topic entries, which may include regular topics, "sticky" topics, and "announcement" topics. The key is to extract a unique Topic ID and a usable URL for each.
- Pay attention to the structure of links within topic entries to find Topic IDs (e.g., `topic=N` in `viewtopic.php` URLs) and the full topic titles.
- The system should be designed to process a single HTML page's content as input.

## Project Structure Notes

- The `docs/index.md` file, which is intended to be the primary guide for locating project documentation, was not found.
- A specific `docs/project-structure.md` file was not found in the root `docs/` directory. Further clarification on project structure for generated files or modules may be needed if this story involves creating them outside of the main application logic. For this story, the primary output is data extraction logic.

## Deviation Analysis

- No deviations from detailed design documents noted at this stage, primarily as detailed design documents beyond the PRD and Tech Stack for this specific module have not been located.

## Testing Guidance

- **Approach:** Unit testing is recommended for the parsing module.
- **Test Scenarios:** Based on Acceptance Criteria, tests should cover:
    - HTML pages with varying numbers of topics (full, partially full, last page).
    - HTML structures for regular, "sticky", and "announcement" topics.
    - Pages where some topic elements might be malformed or unparsable (to test error handling and skipping).
    - Verification of correct data extraction (Title, Topic ID, URL) for valid topic elements.
    - Verification of de-duplication for topics from a single page processing.
- **Success Criteria:** All Acceptance Criteria must be met by the developed module.
- **Test Data:** A collection of representative sample HTML snippets or full page contents from The Magic Cafe forum will be required to cover these scenarios.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Gemini 2.5 Pro`

### Completion Notes List
- Implemented `ExtractTopics` function in `internal/indexer/topic/topic.go` using `goquery`.
- Added comprehensive unit tests in `internal/indexer/topic/topic_test.go`.
- Integrated topic extraction into `cmd/indexer/main.go` to process all pages of a sub-forum.
- The solution correctly identifies topic titles, IDs, and URLs from The Magic Cafe forum pages.
- Handles sticky topics and ensures de-duplication both on a single page and across multiple pages of a sub-forum.
- Error logging is in place for parsing issues.
