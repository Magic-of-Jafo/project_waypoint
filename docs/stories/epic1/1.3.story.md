# Story 1.3: Implement Two-Pass Indexing Strategy for Sub-Forums

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a Developer of the Indexing System,
- I want to implement a two-pass processing logic when indexing any given sub-forum. This involves performing an initial full scan of all its thread listing pages, followed immediately by a targeted re-scan of only its first thread listing page,
- So that I can accurately capture unique Topic IDs (and any readily available associated metadata like titles or directly linked URLs) for topics that may have been reordered to the front page or newly added due to recent replies that occurred during the initial full scan of that sub-forum, thus maximizing data completeness for subsequent archival.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. For a designated target sub-forum, the system MUST first execute a complete scan of all its thread listing pages (using the navigation logic from Story 1.1) and collect all encountered unique Topic IDs (and any readily available associated titles/URLs, as per Story 1.2 logic) into a preliminary, de-duplicated list for that sub-forum.
2. Immediately upon completion of the full scan (AC1) for that specific sub-forum, the system MUST automatically re-fetch and re-parse the HTML content of only the first page of that same sub-forum's thread listings.
3. The system MUST extract all Topic IDs (and any associated titles/URLs) from this re-scanned first page using the logic from Story 1.2.
4. The system MUST compare the Topic IDs obtained from the re-scanned first page (AC3) against the preliminary list of Topic IDs gathered during the full scan (AC1).
5. Any Topic IDs identified in AC4 as present on the re-scanned first page but not in the preliminary list MUST be added to the final master list of Topic IDs for that sub-forum.
6. The final compiled list of Topic IDs for the sub-forum MUST be de-duplicated, ensuring each Topic ID is present only once.
7. The system MUST log the start and completion of the initial full scan phase for the sub-forum.
8. The system MUST log the start and completion of the first-page re-scan phase for the sub-forum.
9. The system SHOULD log the number of new or "bumped" Topic IDs that were identified and added to the master list specifically as a result of the first-page re-scan.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1): Implement initial full scan phase.
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create function to orchestrate full scan using Story 1.1\'s navigation logic.
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Integrate Story 1.2\'s topic extraction logic for each page.
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Implement preliminary list management with de-duplication.
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 2, 3): Implement first page re-scan phase.
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create function to fetch and parse first page content.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Reuse Story 1.2\'s topic extraction logic for re-scan.
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 4, 5, 6): Implement comparison and final list compilation.
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Create function to compare Topic IDs between full scan and re-scan.
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Implement logic to add new Topic IDs to final list.
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Ensure final list de-duplication.
- [x] Task 4 (AC: 7, 8, 9): Implement comprehensive logging.
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Add logging for full scan phase start/completion.
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Add logging for re-scan phase start/completion.
  - [x] Subtask 4.3: Add logging for new/bumped Topic IDs count.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- This story builds directly on the functionality from Stories 1.1 and 1.2:
  - Story 1.1 provides the page navigation logic to scan all pages of a sub-forum.
  - Story 1.2 provides the topic extraction logic to parse individual pages.
- Primary technology: Go (as specified in tech-stack.md).
- The two-pass strategy is critical for data completeness, as it accounts for forum dynamics where new posts can cause topics to be "bumped" to the front page during the initial scan.
- The system should maintain a clear separation between the full scan and re-scan phases, with appropriate state management to track progress and results.
- Error handling should be implemented at both the full scan and re-scan levels, with appropriate logging.
- The system should be designed to handle cases where the first page re-scan might fail (e.g., network issues) without losing the results from the full scan.

## Project Structure Notes

- The `docs/index.md` file, which is intended to be the primary guide for locating project documentation, was not found.
- A specific `docs/project-structure.md` file was not found in the root `docs/` directory.
- This story primarily involves orchestrating the functionality from Stories 1.1 and 1.2, so it should be implemented in a way that cleanly integrates with those modules.
- The implementation should be designed to work with the persistent storage mechanism that will be implemented in Story 1.4.

## Deviation Analysis

- No deviations from detailed design documents noted at this stage, primarily as detailed design documents beyond the PRD and Tech Stack for this specific module have not been located.
- The implementation will need to ensure compatibility with the storage format that will be defined in Story 1.4.

## Testing Guidance

- **Approach:** Unit testing and integration testing are both important for this story.
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Full scan phase:
    - Sub-forums with varying numbers of pages
    - Sub-forums with different topic densities
    - Error handling during full scan
  - Re-scan phase:
    - First page with no new/bumped topics
    - First page with new topics
    - First page with bumped topics
    - Error handling during re-scan
  - Integration scenarios:
    - Complete two-pass process on a small sub-forum
    - Verification of de-duplication across both passes
    - Verification of logging completeness
- **Success Criteria:** All Acceptance Criteria must be met by the developed module.
- **Test Data:** A collection of representative sub-forum pages will be required, including scenarios where topics are bumped or new topics are added during scanning.
