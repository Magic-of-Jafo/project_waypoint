# Story 1.5: Implement Indexing Performance Metrics & ETC Calculation

## Status: Done

## Story

- As an Operator of the Indexing System,
- I want the system to actively track its performance metrics (such as indexing rate) in real-time and use this data to provide dynamically updated Estimated Time to Completion (ETC) for the current sub-forum indexing task, as well as to generate initial ETCs for future, unstarted sub-forums based on historical performance,
- So that I can effectively monitor the progress of long-running indexing tasks, manage my expectations regarding timelines, and better plan the overall forum indexing effort.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  The Indexing System MUST continuously track its processing rate during operation (e.g., number of sub-forum pages processed per minute, and/or number of unique Topic IDs collected per minute).
2.  While indexing a sub-forum, the system MUST display and regularly update (e.g., every few minutes or after processing a set number of pages) an Estimated Time to Completion (ETC) for the *current* sub-forum.
3.  The ETC for the current sub-forum MUST be calculated based on the system's real-time measured processing rate for that sub-forum and the remaining number of known pages (or estimated topics) for that sub-forum.
4.  The accuracy of the dynamically updated ETC for the current sub-forum SHOULD improve as more of that sub-forum is processed.
5.  Upon completion of indexing a sub-forum, the system MUST log key performance metrics for that run, such as the total time taken, average processing rate, and total items processed.
6.  This historical performance data (e.g., average processing rates from completed sub-forum runs) MUST be stored persistently in a simple local format (e.g., a log file, a small database, or a structured text file).
7.  Before initiating the indexing of a *new* (unstarted) sub-forum, the system (or an associated utility function) MUST be able to provide an initial ETC. This estimate should be based on the known size of the new sub-forum (e.g., total estimated number of pages, from Story 1.1's output) and the stored historical average performance data.
8.  All displayed ETCs and logged processing rates MUST be presented in a clear, human-readable format (e.g., "ETC: ~2 hours 30 minutes", "Rate: 15 pages/minute").
9.  The collection and calculation of performance metrics and ETCs MUST NOT significantly degrade the primary performance or stability of the indexing tasks themselves.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4): Implement real-time performance tracking and current ETC.
    - [x] Subtask 1.1: Design data structures for tracking processing rates (pages/min, topics/min).
    - [x] Subtask 1.2: Implement logic to update processing rates as indexing progresses.
    - [x] Subtask 1.3: Develop formula for calculating current ETC based on rate and remaining items.
    - [x] Subtask 1.4: Implement display/logging mechanism for current ETC (updated regularly).
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 5, 6): Implement historical performance data logging and storage.
    - [x] Subtask 2.1: Define format for storing historical performance data (e.g., JSON lines in a log file).
    - [x] Subtask 2.2: Implement logic to log key metrics upon sub-forum completion.
    - [x] Subtask 2.3: Ensure persistent storage of historical data.
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 7): Implement initial ETC for new sub-forums.
    - [x] Subtask 3.1: Create function/utility to read stored historical performance data.
    - [x] Subtask 3.2: Develop logic to calculate initial ETC using historical averages and new sub-forum size (from Story 1.1 output).
- [x] Task 4 (AC: 8): Ensure human-readable output for metrics.
    - [x] Subtask 4.1: Format all displayed/logged rates and ETCs clearly.
- [x] Task 5 (AC: 9): Optimize for minimal performance impact.
    - [x] Subtask 5.1: Profile metrics collection/calculation to identify bottlenecks.
    - [x] Subtask 5.2: Optimize logic to ensure it doesn't slow down core indexing.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- This system will provide crucial operational feedback to the user.
- Primary technology: Go (as specified in `docs/tech-stack.md`).
- Metrics should be updated at a reasonable interval (e.g., every 10-30 seconds or after a certain number of pages processed) to provide timely feedback without excessive overhead.
- The calculation for remaining items will depend on the output of Story 1.1 (total pages in a sub-forum).
- Historical data storage should be simple and robust. A structured log file (e.g., JSONL) is a good candidate.
- Consider edge cases for ETC calculation: e.g., when a sub-forum is very small, or when historical data is not yet available (for the very first run).
- The "utility function" for initial ETC (AC7) could be part of the main indexing script or a separate small tool.

## Project Structure Notes

- This functionality will likely be a module integrated into the core indexing script.
- The persistent storage for historical data should be in a configurable location, possibly managed by the storage system defined in Story 1.4 or a simpler local file path.

## Deviation Analysis

- No deviations from PRD anticipated.

## Testing Guidance

- **Approach:** Unit tests for calculation logic, integration tests to see metrics update during a simulated indexing run.
- **Test Scenarios:**
    - Correct calculation of processing rates.
    - Dynamic ETC updates during a run (ETC should decrease over time).
    - Accurate logging of final performance metrics.
    - Correct storage and retrieval of historical performance data.
    - Plausible initial ETC calculation for new sub-forums (with and without historical data).
    - Human-readable formatting of all outputs.
    - Performance impact assessment (should be negligible).
- **Success Criteria:** All Acceptance Criteria must be met.
- **Test Data:** Mock data for sub-forum sizes, simulated processing times for pages/topics.
