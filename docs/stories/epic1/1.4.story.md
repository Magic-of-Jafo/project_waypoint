# Story 1.4: Implement Storage System for Waypoint Archive

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a Developer of the Waypoint Archive,
- I want to implement a robust storage system that can efficiently store and manage the raw HTML content and structured data from The Magic Cafe forum,
- So that we can securely preserve all forum content and enable efficient access for subsequent processing and future use.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The system MUST allow configuration of a base storage path (e.g., via a configuration file or environment variable). All subsequent paths are relative to this base path.
2. The system MUST implement a hierarchical directory structure under the configured base path for storing raw HTML files, organized by:
   - Sub-forum ID
   - Topic ID
   - Page number within topic
   - Example relative path: `raw-html/subforum-{id}/topic-{id}/page-{number}.html`

3. The system MUST implement a separate directory structure under the configured base path for storing structured JSON data, organized by:
   - Sub-forum ID
   - Topic ID
   - Example relative path: `structured-json/subforum-{id}/topic-{id}.json`

4. The system MUST implement a metadata index file for each sub-forum under the configured base path that tracks:
   - Total number of topics
   - Total number of pages per topic
   - Last update timestamp
   - Example relative path: `metadata/subforum-{id}/index.json`

5. The system MUST implement a global progress tracking file under the configured base path that records:
   - Overall archival progress
   - Last processed sub-forum
   - Last processed topic
   - Last processed page
   - Example relative path: `progress.json`

6. The system MUST implement file naming conventions that ensure:
   - Unique identification of all files
   - Easy parsing of file relationships
   - Compatibility with the Synology NAS filesystem

7. The system MUST implement a storage quota monitoring system that:
   - Tracks total space used
   - Provides warnings when approaching capacity limits
   - Logs storage metrics

8. The system MUST implement a backup strategy that:
   - Creates regular backups of the metadata and progress files
   - Maintains a backup log
   - Provides backup status reporting

9. The system MUST implement error handling for:
   - Disk space exhaustion
   - File system permission issues
   - Network connectivity problems
   - File corruption

## Dev Technical Guidance

- This story builds upon the indexing functionality from Stories 1.1-1.3.
- Primary technology: Go (as specified in tech-stack.md).
- The base storage path for the Waypoint Archive (e.g., targeting the Synology NAS) should be configurable (e.g., through a configuration file or environment variable) to avoid hardcoding paths within the application.
- The storage system should be designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
- File operations should be atomic where possible to prevent corruption.
- The system should be designed to be resilient to network issues and power failures.
- Consider implementing a simple locking mechanism to prevent concurrent writes to the same files.
- The storage system should be designed to work with the Synology NAS's filesystem capabilities.

## Project Structure Notes

- The storage system will be a critical component of the Waypoint Archive.
- The implementation should be designed to work seamlessly with the HTML archival process that will be implemented in subsequent stories.
- The storage system should be designed to support future expansion and additional features.

## Deviation Analysis

- No deviations from detailed design documents noted at this stage.
- The implementation will need to ensure compatibility with the Synology NAS's filesystem and network capabilities.

## Testing Guidance

- **Approach:** Unit testing and integration testing are both important for this story.
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Directory structure creation and validation
  - File naming and relationship parsing
  - Metadata and progress tracking
  - Storage quota monitoring
  - Backup operations
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Concurrent access handling
- **Success Criteria:** All Acceptance Criteria must be met by the developed module.
- **Test Data:** A collection of sample HTML files and structured data will be required for testing.
